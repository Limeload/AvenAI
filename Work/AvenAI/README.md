## 🧩 How It Works

### 🗂️ Step 1: Web Scraping Aven
We extracted data from Aven’s [support site](https://www.aven.com/support) using scraping tools and cleaned the text.

### 🔎 Step 2: Embedding & Indexing
- Content was chunked and embedded using **OpenAI Embedding API**
- Stored in **Pinecone** vector database

### 🤖 Step 3: RAG Pipeline
- On a user query:
  - Top-k relevant chunks are retrieved from Pinecone
  - These are passed to **GPT-3.5/4** to generate a contextual response
  - Source citations are included in the answer

### 💬 Step 4: Chat + Voice UI
- Built using **Next.js** and **React**
- Voice input handled using **Vapi**
- Chat UI provides instant answers with source references

### 🔒 Bonus Features
- **Guardrails**: Filters sensitive or inappropriate questions
- **Meeting Scheduler**: Triggers appointment logic (e.g., Calendly/Google Calendar)
- **Evaluation Set**: Manual test set with ~50 user-style queries
