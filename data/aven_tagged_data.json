Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven's control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.\n\n- How does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\n\n- Does Aven offer a fixed rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nSome Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment, fixed rate Simple Loan plans. Applicants can check their details in their account agreement.\n\n- Is Aven a credit card or a home equity line of credit? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIt is both! Aven is a home equity line of credit that customers access through a credit card. Aven cardholders can use their Aven Card wherever VISA cards are accepted.\n\nAven cardholders can transfer cash directly from their Aven account to another bank account \u2013 it is called a CashOut. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\n\nTo transfer balance from a high interest credit card to the Aven card, cardholders can request a balance transfer (BT) to their credit card. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\n\n\n##### Payments\n\n- How are payments calculated for fixed installment plans? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven offers fixed payment plans that amortize over several years, details being in the account agreement. The payment is calculated so that the entire amount of the plan and the interest is paid off by the end of the selected term. For payment estimates, please visit [https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator](https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator)\n\n- How do you compute my minimum due every month? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nFor revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan's minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. For payment estimates, please visit [https://aven.com/paymentCalculator](https://aven.com/paymentCalculator).\n\n- Is there a prepayment penalty? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThere is no a prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment. Cardholders can also find more details about their Account Agreement, here [https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails](https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails)\n\nImportant Note: If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released. Aven is unable to waive or shorten this wait period.\n\n- How is interest calculated on the Aven account? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nInterest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type.\n\n\n- For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase.\n- For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed.\n- Any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation.\n\nIn addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal.\n\nIf an account has zero balance in any cycle, there will be no payment due for that cycle.\n\n- When is the monthly payment due? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nStatements are generated each month close to the monthly anniversary of when cardholders signed up for an Aven account. Payment due dates are highlighted in the statement as well as in the Aven Card app. Statements are available on the Aven app and online: [https://my.aven.com/statements](https://my.aven.com/statements)\n\n- How can I make a payment on my monthly statement? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven cardholders can pay their Aven bill using the Aven Card\u00a0 app. Please note that Aven does not accept checks or cash by mail.

We then calculate interest on this balance for the duration of the billing cycle, using the rate in effect on the last day of the billing cycle.

We offer it solely to provide our customers with peace of mind when using their home equity.

What happens if only one of us loses their job while we are enrolled in Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIf either of the co-borrowers experiences involuntary unemployment, the account will be covered for the coverage listed above.\n\n- What happens if I don\u2019t pay the Debt Protection fee? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIf you don\u2019t pay your Debt Protection fees, the loan addendum will be considered lapsed and you will not be eligible to file a claim in the event of involuntary unemployment. Even if you are not able to pay your minimum monthly payment for Aven, as long as you pay your Debt Protection fees, you will be eligible to file a claim.\n\n- Can I appeal a claim decision for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThere is no option to appeal at this time. Securian's claim decision is final.\n\n- Do I need to be current on my account to file a Debt Protection claim? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nNo. You may file a claim even if you are delinquent. However, you will need to remit the Debt Protection fees owed in order to process the claim. The cardholder has active coverage if the protection has not lapsed. Please note, if a claim is successful, it will not bring your account current.\n\n- Are there any exclusions to filing a claim for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nDebt protection is not possible in the following cases:\n\n\n- A customer retires, quits, or resigns\n- A claim occurs in first 90 days of issuance\n- A claim occurs on or after 70th birthday\n\n- How do I file a claim for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nEmail us at support@aven.com or go to the Debt Protection tab located in the sidebar menu of your Aven mobile application.\n\nThere you will see a link to file a claim. You will be routed to Securian Financial - our claims administrator - to provide details related to your job loss event and submit documentation.\n\nOnce a decision has been made, Securian Financial will notify you and Aven and issue a payment to Aven under the contractual liability policy. Please note that the cancellation date would be effective as of the date of unemployment.\n\n- How are Debt Protection fees calculated? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThe monthly rate charged is $0.92 per $1,000 of balances for single accounts and $1.75 per $1,000 of balances for joint accounts.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you have $30,000 of outstanding balances at your statement date, you would see a $27.60 charge as a single account holder and a $52.50 charge as a joint account holder in the following statement. Fees are always paid for balances in arrears.\n\n\n\nThis fee will show up on your monthly statement as a separate charge. As long as you are current on paying these fees, you will be able to file a claim in the event of involuntary job loss.\n\n- How much am I covered for with Debt Protection? Are there any limitations with Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nDebt Protection covers participating customers up to $50,000 in total payments and up to $1,000 in monthly payments for up to 6 months. Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence.\n\n\n\nAs an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.\n\n\n\nPlease note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current.\n\n- Is Debt Protection considered an insurance product? How does Debt Protection work? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nNo, Debt Protection is not an insurance protection. Anyone who elects to join will sign an addendum to their loan agreement with Aven. In the event of involuntary job loss, Aven will cancel up to six months of a borrower\u2019s monthly payments per occurrence of job loss if the claim is approved.\n\n\n\nAven maintains a contractual liability policy and administrative services agreement with Securian Financial. In the event of a Debt Protection claim, Securian would approve it and reimburse funds to Aven Financial.\n\n- Who is eligible for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIn order to qualify, you must:\n\n\n- Be under 70 years old\n- Actively work a minimum of 24 hours per week\n- Not be self-employed\n\n- What is Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nFor a small monthly fee, you can protect yourself and your home for up to six months per occurrence of involuntary job loss. Aven makes no money from this offering - we offer it strictly for the benefit of any customers who are worried about potentially losing their home.\n\n\n\nPlease note, this product is only meant to help you manage your Aven card. Aven may still foreclose if the max monthly claim payment from debt protection is not sufficient to cover the minimum monthly payment due. Additionally, your first lien holder may still foreclose if you fall into default on mortgage payments.\n\n\nSHOW MORE\n\n##### Can't find what you need?\n\nSearch question, keywords, or

It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Percent Sign Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/rateIcon.bdf34906.svg)\n\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\n\nFor Cash Outs, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. One time 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.[4](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_4)\n\n![Calculator Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/paymentIcon.c7d44db7.svg)\n\nWhat is my monthly payment?\n\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. [See Payment Calculator](https://www.aven.com/PaymentCalculator).\n\n![Cash Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/cashIcon.12b80785.svg)\n\nCan I get cash too?\n\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Meter Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/creditScoreIcon.57152ad7.svg)\n\nDoes this affect my credit score?\n\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\n\n![Price Tag Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/feesIcon.54015658.svg)\n\nAre there any fees?\n\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don\u2019t make the minimum payment.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n##### More Questions...\n\nSearch\n\n# Become an Expert\n\n## Grow your knowledge with our educational articles written by our team of experts.\n\n[![Can you get cash from Aven card?](https://www.aven.com/img/can-you-get-cash-aven-card.b4532e86.webp)\\\n**Can you get cash from Aven card?** \\\n\\\nYes!

    "text": "Now that you understand what a HELOC Card is, let\u2019s dive into how it works. This article also explains where you can use your card and how it differs from the credit cards in your wallet. How to get a HELOC Card To use a traditional HELOC, you typically need to transfer funds to a checking account before making purchases or use special checks issued to you by the lender. This process can be complicated, time-consuming and frustrating. Some lenders will instead give you a HELOC Card to use at your convenience so you can access your funds immediately. However, there are several requirements to be eligible to apply, including: proving you have a steady income, being listed on your home\u2019s title, having a certain credit score and possessing a valid ID. If you meet the requirements, the application process typically looks something like this: Complete the online application, which asks questions about yourself and your home Verify your income by providing pay stubs or a company verification letter Meet with a notary to sign required documents Receive your card within a few business days Where can HELOC funds be used? Once your card arrives in the mail, you can start making purchases with it right away. You can use your card at any merchant that accepts major credit cards, like Visa and MasterCard. Experts recommend using a HELOC Card for purchases that help increase wealth over the long run. For example, many homeowners tend to use their funds on home improvements or remodeling, which can significantly increase the property\u2019s value. You can also use the card to transfer balances from personal loans or other credit cards. While there are no restrictions on what products or services you can purchase with a HELOC Card, financial advisors typically advise against using your card on frivolous items or experiences, such as vacations or a new car, which are unlikely to increase your wealth. These types of purchases could even make it harder to pay off your HELOC balance in the future. How to pay for charges made on a HELOC Card Every month, you will receive a statement with your charges, much like you do with a traditional credit card. The monthly bill for a HELOC Card from Aven, for example, consists of 1% of the principal balance plus finance and interest charges on the average daily balance during your last billing cycle. If you choose to pay only your minimum balance each month, it can take you a very long time to pay your balance back. You can choose to pay more than the minimum or to make payments more often than once a month if you'd like to pay down your debt sooner. If you can't pay your monthly bill on time, you will likely incur a late fee. How is a HELOC Card different from a credit card? While a HELOC Card is used in a similar way as a regular credit card, they are not the same. The main difference is that a HELOC Card uses your home\u2019s equity to secure the loan, while a credit card doesn\u2019t require any collateral. Consequently, HELOC Cards have much lower interest rates than credit cards. However, unlike with a credit card, the rate is usually variable, meaning it moves up and down based on a benchmark rate. Are you looking for a HELOC Card? Aven is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back. Aven is the world's first home equity-backed credit card and combines the low interest rates of a home equity line of credit with the flexibility of a credit card. Click here to learn more!",

What they haven\u2019t historically been so good at is addressing personal finance needs as they relate to your rent or mortgage.\n\nRecently, though, homeowners have a specific credit card to get excited about. The Aven Home card is designed to be a cross between a rewards card and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Given the unique hybrid nature of this offer, I think it has the potential to change the way we think about credit cards, particularly among home owners.\n\n> BONUS TIP!\n>\n> Don\u2019t feel left out, Renters! There\u2019s a card aimed at helping you out in an all-new way as well: The [CardName](https://www.cardratings.com/cashback/aven-home-card-is-it-worth-it.html) discontinued allows you to earn rewards on your rent payments without incurring any transaction or processing fees.\n\n## How does the Aven Home card work?\n\nWhen it comes to day-to-day use, the Aven card works like a regular Visa card, so you can enjoy the convenience of a credit card with the lower interest rates associated with a HELOC. It\u2019s the underwriting and fee structure of the Aven credit card that sets it apart\u2013 basically, the card utilizes your home\u2019s equity as a form of collateral to secure your credit line and lower rates.\n\nWhen you apply for the card, the issuer will verify your income and credit score/history as well as the equity in your home. Assuming you\u2019re approved, you\u2019ll receive the card in the mail soon after.\n\n> Home equity loan vs. Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)\n>\n> How does a HELOC differ from a home equity loan? In short:\n>\n> - A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a loan secured by the borrower\u2019s home \u2013 your home is collateral for the money you borrow. HELOCs are good for major expenses (think college or medical debt) because rates will be lowered, but this loan is only good if you can afford it, and your income is incredibly stable.\n> - A home equity loan is a loan of a fixed amount of money secured by your home. Upon agreeing to a home equity loan you\u2019ll agree to equal monthly payments over a set timeframe. Because this loan is a fixed amount it is a good option for one-time events \u2013 like paying down higher APR credit card debt. Just as with a HELOC your loan is secured by your home, ensuring you have amble opportunity to pay the loan back is imperative before moving forward with this option.\n\nYour monthly minimum payments will be 1% of your principal balance, plus interest and any fees. It\u2019s a setup that\u2019s fairly typical for a credit card.\n\nWhere Aven differs is that you have the option to set up fixed monthly payments for balance transfers and cash outs. In that case, you won\u2019t pay interest on those transactions, but you will pay a set monthly fee. A number of mainstream banks, including Chase and Citibank, offer similar payment setups for certain purchases on their qualifying cards.\n\n\u27a4\u00a0LEARN MORE: [Credit card built-in fixed APR personal loans vs. traditional personal loans](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/debt/credit-card-built-in-fixed-apr-personal-loans-vs-traditional-personal-loans.html)\n\nIf you\u2019re considering the Aven credit card as a balance transfer option, it\u2019s best to not think about it as a purchase card option until that balance is paid off.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in credit card debt, stop using your cards \\[for new purchases\\],\u201d advises Beverly Harzog, consumer finance analyst and author of\u00a0\u201cThe Debt Escape Plan: How to Free Yourself from Credit Card Balances, Boost Your Credit Score, and Live Debt-Free.\u201d \u201cFocus on becoming debt-free. This can be challenging, but as you pay down debt, your credit score will start to increase. You\u2019ll feel a rush of adrenaline that will help you stick with it!\u201d\n\n## Highlights of the Aven credit card\n\n- 7.99%-15.49% variable APR on purchases, balance transfers and cash advances. Your initial rate is based on your\u00a0[credit score](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/vantagescore-vs-fico.html)\n- Up to a $250,000 credit limit, which is MUCH higher than the\u00a0typical card limit of around $3,952\n- Offers\u00a0[balance transfers](https://www.cardratings.com/balance-transfer/what-is-a-balance-transfer.html)\u00a0and cash outs (directly deposit cash from your card to your bank account, which is similar to a\u00a0[credit card cash advance](https://www.cardratings.com/cashback/can-i-get-cash-back-when-i-buy-something-with-a-credit-card.html)) and you have the option of fixed rate monthly payments. Unlike other cards, you can also lock in your payments for five or 10 years. (One-time 2.5 % transfer fee applies for both transfers and cash outs).\n- You can use funds from a cash out for any purpose and, unlike almost all other credit cards that charge a higher rate for cash advances, the cash out rate is the same as the fixed purchase rate\n- 2% unlimited cash back on all purchases\n- Potentially lower fees than a traditional HELOC and a more streamlined, faster application and approval process\n\n## Details of the Aven Home card\n\n### Rewards\n\nAven cardholders earn 2% cash back on every purchases, which is on par with other flat-rate cash-back cards and higher than the base rate of many tiered rate cash-back cards.\n\nRewards, however, aren\u2019t terribly flexible. You can redeem your cash back for statement credit, which could save you a bit of money but won\u2019t allow you to strategically maximize the rewards as you can with some points/cash-back cards.\n\n### Card fees\n\n**Annual fee:** The Aven card offers a $0 annual fee option for all applicants.\n\n**Balance transfer fee:** There\u2019s a 2.5% fee for balance transfers, which is higher than the typical fee. If you REALLY need a lengthy period of time (say, more than 18 months) to pay off a chunk of debt, it _might_ be worth it. That said, there are plenty of balance transfer credit cards out there that offer a 0% APR period (15-18 months isn\u2019t hard to find for people with excellent credit) and a fee of 3%. Taken together, that could prove a much better option for most people.\n\n**Cash advance fee:** Again, there\u2019s a 2.5% cash advance fee BUT cash advances enjoy the same interest rate as purchases, which is highly unusual. With most cards, you\u2019ll pay a higher interest rate for cash advances than for purchases and balance transfers.\n\n**Loan origination fees:** There\u2019s aren\u2019t any! This is where the card shines for people considering a HELOC. In many cases, a HELOC has some origination and processing fees to get your started; but you pay any of that with the Aven card.\n\n**APR:** The card advertises that you get \u201creally, really low rates\u201d. While I don\u2019t totally agree with the phrase \u201creally, really low rates,\u201d this card does offer a purchase rate as low as 7.99% (not an\u00a0[introductory or teaser rate](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/0-apr/best-practices-saving-with-an-intro-0-apr-card.html)). In comparison, the national average is around 20%\u00a0[according to NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/credit-card-interest-rates-hit-record-high-rcna56373).\n\n\u201cCompared to other credit cards, most of which now have high double digit rates, this is a good deal,\u201d notes Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, author of the New York Times bestseller \u201cZero Debt: The Ultimate Guide to Financial Freedom\u201d and affectionately known as the\u00a0[Money Coach](https://themoneycoach.net/).\n\n> BONUS TIP!\n>\n> If you take out a traditional HELOC and use it exclusively for home improvements, the interest on that loan is tax deductible. Talk with a tax adviser about the deductibility of projects completed using your Aven card.\n\n## Are there any potential \u2018gotchas\u2019 with the Aven card?\n\nThe Aven credit card is definitely more complicated than the average card, but really only as it relates to how you qualify and what kind of payment structure you\u2019re anticipating. While this alone isn\u2019t a big cause for concern, there are other potential issues worth discussing.\n\n**1)**\u00a0There\u2019s no question that Aven card has attractive rates and a unique value proposition, but the real question is who exactly this offer is best suited for. Obviously, getting a HELOC is not a light decision, particularly since you could lose your house if you get too far behind in payments (since the HELOC is secured by your home)!\n\n\u201cAven has excellent rates because they use your home as collateral, which can be risky,\u201d explains Harzog. \u201cSo, think carefully about using the Aven card over, say, an unsecured card with rewards.\u201d\n\nKhalfani-Cox points out this card could be a smart choice for applicants who \u201care financially disciplined and pay their card balances in a timely manner.\u201d\n\n**2)**\u00a0Related to point #1, the BIG red flag on this offer is the very real prospect of overspending due to potentially having a large\u00a0[credit line](https://www.cardratings.com/what-factors-determine-the-credit-limit-you-get-on-a-credit-card.html) of up to $250,000 (depending on your credit score and how much equity you have in your house).\n\nWhile you might have this same issue if you got a traditional HELOC (one not attached to a card), using this card with a much larger than normal credit line may be extra tempting and cause some consumers to blow their\u00a0[monthly budget](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/should-you-take-a-charging-break.html).\n\n![quote](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nIf you think you lack the self restraint required to manage this line of credit \u2014 and \\[would be\\] tempted to utilize your home equity excessively or for unwise purchases \u2014 do yourself a favor and avoid the possibility of maxing out this card, and potentially putting both your credit rating and your home at risk.\n\n\u2014 Lynnette Khalfani-Cox, The Money Coach\n\n**3)** While it\u2019s nice to be able to pay off other cards and debts with a fixed monthly payment using the cash-out feature, this feature may not be the best option when considering that [the best 0% balance transfer offers can last up to 21 months](https://www.cardratings.com/best-balance-transfer-credit-cards.html)\u00a0(assuming you can pay off the 0% transfer within the introductory time frame).\n\nThe key takeaway here is why pay a low interest rate, when you can potentially pay no interest!\n\n\u201cThis is an interesting offer and it has some benefits if you have good credit and qualify for a low interest rate,\u201d Harzog explains. \u201cIf you have debt on high-interest credit cards, you can do a balance transfer so you can pay your balance off at a lower rate.\u201d\n\n![quote](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\n\nBut if you have card debt and still have a very good credit score, it\u2019s better to \\[do a normal\\] balance transfer and get a 0% rate for a period of time.\n\n\u2014 Beverly Harzog, Consumer Finance Analyst\n\n## Does Aven offer a competitive rewards program?\n\nThe short answer is that Aven does offer competitive rebates, but it\u2019s not the \u201cbest of breed\u201d when compared to other cash-back offers. If you really like the 2% unlimited cash back benefit on all purchases, you should be aware that there are \u201cnormal\u201d rebate cards that offer [2% cash back on purchases (or more) with no annual fees](https://www.cardratings.com/best-credit-cards-for-cash-back-rewards.html#card3387).\n\nIf you are trying to pay down debt, that extra .5% (or more) on some purchases could help you out.\n\n\u201cPaying down debt could make my earnings go further rather than just using my cash back to buy stuff off Amazon like I\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d notes Scott Bonge, the founder of\u00a0[MyPerfectGoatee.com](https://www.myperfectgoatee.com/), and a long-term rewards credit card user.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a matter of personal preference, money-management style and existing credit resources,\u201d Khalfani-Cox adds. \u201cSomeone who doesn\u2019t need a HELOC, perhaps because they already have one or don\u2019t want to draw down on that line, may be better off with a traditional 2% cash back card.\n\n\u201cBut for someone who prefers lower rates (ongoing, not intro.) and/or having the flexibility that a HELOC-type card provides, the Aven card may be more beneficial.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line is that while Aven has a decent rewards program, you shouldn\u2019t apply for this offer solely based on it\u2019s rewards program. The rebates should be viewed simply as an added bonus (pun intended).\n\n> BONUS TIP!\n>\n> As is the case with other reward cards, you can not earn rebates on balance transfers and cash outs. The redemption options for Aven are limited as cash-back rebates are only redeemable as a statement credit (you can\u2019t get gift cards, a check in the mail, etc).\n\n## Final thoughts\n\nThe Aven Home card has introduced a creative way for homeowners to conveniently take advantage of their equity. I love their hybrid approach and I do believe this offer can definitely be a blessing to a certain demographic, particularly when considering the economic environment we find ourselves in.\n\nI also love the balance transfer and cash out feature, but would caution current and potential cardholders to remember a few \u201cold school\u201d debt reduction principles when using this new card to consolidate and/or pay down debt.\n\n\u201cIn general, I recommend people prioritize paying off their debts organically \u2014 meaning they use cash to pay it off, not another form of borrowing,\u201d Khalfani-Cox elaborates. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between a \u2018zero debt'\u201d\u2018 strategy \u2014 which seeks to eliminate debt progressively \u2014 and a \u2018shift debt\u2019 strategy, which really just pushes the debt around from one form of credit or borrowing to another.\n\n_\u201c_ Because I once had a ton of credit card debt before paying it off, I do understand the \u2018shift debt\u2019 strategy,\u201d Khalfani-Cox conitinues. \u201cIt\u2019s the same strategy, in effect, that people have used (myself included) when they do balance transfers. You get a little breathing room, maybe a 0% interest rate, and the opportunity to more aggressively attack your debts. So although a \u2018shift debt\u2019 strategy can be helpful in the short-run, it\u2019s not a viable long-term strategy to actually get rid of the debt. Ultimately, you do have to pay the piper and pay off what you owe.\u201d\n\nUltimately, as Khalfani-Cox reminded me in a recent interview, it pays to have a set of rules for when you will use credit. Ask yourself: under what circumstances and for what types of purchases will I use this card or this form of credit \u2014 and then stick to that. By setting up some pre-established guidelines and criteria for credit usage, you\u2019ll become a lot better at managing credit wisely and avoiding the pitfall of excessive credit use.\n\nI sincerely hope these insider tips are helpful to you and would love your feedback on your personal experiences with the Aven card, balance transfers and card debt. Who knows, I may include feedback from you in a future article.

It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Percent Sign Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/rateIcon.bdf34906.svg)\n\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\n\nFor Cash Outs, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan).

It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. [See Payment Calculator](https://www.aven.com/PaymentCalculator).\n\n![Cash Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/cashIcon.12b80785.svg)\n\nCan I get cash too?\n\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate.

Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\n\n![Price Tag Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/feesIcon.54015658.svg)\n\nAre there any fees?\n\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don\u2019t make the minimum payment.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n##### More Questions...\n\nSearch\n\n# Become an Expert\n\n## Grow your knowledge with our educational articles written by our team of experts.\n\n[![Can you get cash from Aven card?](https://www.aven.com/img/can-you-get-cash-aven-card.b4532e86.webp)\\\n**Can you get cash from Aven card?** \\\n\\\nYes!

An annual due diligence review is performed on all first and second tier vendors. Service providers may use information that was collected from financial institutions and other 3rd party servicers. \n \n Aven may disclose your Personal Information to commercial providers for a business purpose.

It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Percent Sign Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/rateIcon.bdf34906.svg)\n\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\n\nFor Cash Outs, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. One time 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.[4](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_4)\n\n![Calculator Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/paymentIcon.c7d44db7.svg)\n\nWhat is my monthly payment?\n\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. [See Payment Calculator](https://www.aven.com/PaymentCalculator).\n\n![Cash Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/cashIcon.12b80785.svg)\n\nCan I get cash too?\n\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Meter Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/creditScoreIcon.57152ad7.svg)\n\nDoes this affect my credit score?\n\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\n\n![Price Tag Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/feesIcon.54015658.svg)\n\nAre there any fees?\n\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don\u2019t make the minimum payment.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n##### More Questions...\n\nSearch\n\n# Become an Expert\n\n## Grow your knowledge with our educational articles written by our team of experts.\n\n[![Can you get cash from Aven card?](https://www.aven.com/img/can-you-get-cash-aven-card.b4532e86.webp)\\\n**Can you get cash from Aven card?** \\\n\\\nYes!

Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven's control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.\n\n- How does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\n\n- Does Aven offer a fixed rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nSome Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment, fixed rate Simple Loan plans. Applicants can check their details in their account agreement.\n\n- Is Aven a credit card or a home equity line of credit? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIt is both! Aven is a home equity line of credit that customers access through a credit card. Aven cardholders can use their Aven Card wherever VISA cards are accepted.\n\nAven cardholders can transfer cash directly from their Aven account to another bank account \u2013 it is called a CashOut. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\n\nTo transfer balance from a high interest credit card to the Aven card, cardholders can request a balance transfer (BT) to their credit card. There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\n\n\n##### Payments\n\n- How are payments calculated for fixed installment plans? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven offers fixed payment plans that amortize over several years, details being in the account agreement. The payment is calculated so that the entire amount of the plan and the interest is paid off by the end of the selected term. For payment estimates, please visit [https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator](https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator)\n\n- How do you compute my minimum due every month? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nFor revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan's minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. For payment estimates, please visit [https://aven.com/paymentCalculator](https://aven.com/paymentCalculator).\n\n- Is there a prepayment penalty? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThere is no a prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment. Cardholders can also find more details about their Account Agreement, here [https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails](https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails)\n\nImportant Note: If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released. Aven is unable to waive or shorten this wait period.\n\n- How is interest calculated on the Aven account? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nInterest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type.\n\n\n- For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase.\n- For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed.\n- Any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation.\n\nIn addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal.\n\nIf an account has zero balance in any cycle, there will be no payment due for that cycle.\n\n- When is the monthly payment due? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nStatements are generated each month close to the monthly anniversary of when cardholders signed up for an Aven account. Payment due dates are highlighted in the statement as well as in the Aven Card app. Statements are available on the Aven app and online: [https://my.aven.com/statements](https://my.aven.com/statements)\n\n- How can I make a payment on my monthly statement? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven cardholders can pay their Aven bill using the Aven Card\u00a0 app. Please note that Aven does not accept checks or cash by mail. [https://my.aven.com/](https://my.aven.com/)\n\n\n\n[iframe](https://player.vimeo.com/video/736684158?h=a3de1222cd&badge=0&autopause=0&player_id=0&app_id=58479)\n\n- Do missed payments impact a customer's home? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nOne or two late payments will not put a cardholders home at risk or in default. Aven offers multiple hardship services to cardholders who struggle with their payments. Please note that an account may be blocked if no payment is received by the time the next statement is issued.\n\n- Can I pay with a check? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven cardholders can use the Aven Card app to easily connect their bank account using their routing and account number to make a payment. They can also use their existing online banking platforms to make payments to Aven. [https://my.aven.com/](https://my.aven.com/)\n\n- Can I add or remove bank accounts for Auto pay or bill pay? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nCardholders can add or remove bank accounts in the Aven Card app or online at [https://my.aven.com/card](https://my.aven.com/card)\n\n- Does a purchase refund count against the minimum payment due? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nWhile a refunded purchase will reduce a customer's remaining statement balance, it will not count towards the minimum due payment - with one exception:\n\nif there is only one purchase during the cycle, and this purchase is refunded to bring the statement balance to zero, there will be no minimum payment for that cycle.\n\n\nSHOW MORE\n\n##### Before You Apply\n\n- What are the eligibility criteria for applying for Aven? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated and generates an offer based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.

We state this requirement at the top of the page in which the information is collected. This protected information in no way impacts an applicant\u2019s offer, as required by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Housing Act. In fact, applicants have the opportunity to refuse disclosure of this information, as you did, nullifying any opportunity for discrimination.\n\n- Can I pay off an existing HELOC with the Aven Card? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven offers a HELOC refinance product for qualified applicants.\n\n- What credit score or FICO score do you use? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven uses FICO V9 and VantageScore 4.0 from Experian, a top credit reporting agency\n\n- Why do I have to wait the 3 business cancellation or rescission period? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nConsumer protection regulations require that applicants be given three business days to cancel the account because of the security interest in the home. You cannot use the card until the cancellation period (also known as a rescission period) has expired.\n\nThis regulation was established by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) under U.S. federal law, and allows a borrower to cancel a home equity loan, line of credit, or refinance with a new lender, within three days of closing.\n\n- Can I apply or be eligible if my home is in a flood hazard zone? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nYes, Aven does support properties in flood zones.

Aven customer wants to refinance their first mortgage while keeping the Aven card open and active. In this case, Aven will work with the customer's first mortgage lender to complete a subordination agreement.\n2. Aven customer wants to payoff and close the Aven account. In this case, the Aven customer needs to submit a payoff quote request from the Aven app or online. Please note that when Aven receives the payoff request, the account will be blocked from further charges. This is done to prevent the account balance increasing beyond the payoff quote.\n\n- What happens when a house is sold? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nYour settlement agent will send Aven a payoff request. Aven will close the account and release the lien when the balance is paid in full.\n\n- Do mortgage payments have to be current ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven's underwriting system looks at mortgage payment history to determine an applicant's eligibility.

Your Cardholder agreement will specify the Index used for your account.\n\n\n\nWall Street Journal Prime (WSJ Prime): The Wall Street Journal surveys some of the country's biggest banks and publishes a consensus rate based on the survey. This is one of the most common indicies used for many lending products. Look up the latest rates on the [website of the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/moneyrates). https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/moneyrates\n\n\n\nFederal Funds Target Rate - Upper Limit (FFTR-UL): This rate is set by the Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve (FOMC). It is the short-term interest rate at which U.S. Banks and Credit Unions lend to each other overnight within the Federal Reserve system. Look up the latest rates on the [website of the St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=QGiM). [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=QGiM](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=QGiM)\n\n\n\nThe rate on your account is the sum of the index and the margin. Both can be found in your Account Agreement.\n\n- Do you give a HUD-1? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\n\n\nThere is no HUD-1 form associated with the Aven Home Card. The Account Agreement contains all the required information, notices, and disclosures.\n\n- How do applicants get higher credit limits? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nFor applicants, Aven's automated underwriting system cannot modify the credit limit or rate. Aven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated and generates an offer based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\n\n- What is my monthly interest rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nA cardholder's monthly interest rate is their current APR, divided by 365, multiplied by the number of days in that monthly billing cycle.For fixed monthly payment plans, amount, term, and other details are presented and disclosed at the time of plan creation. Cardholders can find their current rates in the Aven App (under \"Account Details\").\u00a0 The effective APR for each billing cycle is also printed in the statement..\n\n- Is the rate variable? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThe Aven Card is a variable rate credit card.

For each billing cycle, we add the interest bearing balance on each day of the cycle and divide it by the number of days in the cycle to get the Average Daily Balance for the billing cycle. We then calculate interest on this balance for the duration of the billing cycle, using the rate in effect on the last day of the billing cycle. Cardholders can find the rate used for the cycle on their statement in the \"Plan Summary\" section towards the end.\n\nFor fixed monthly payment plans, amount, term, and other details are presented and disclosed at the time of plan creation.

As long as you are current on paying these fees, you will be able to file a claim in the event of involuntary job loss.\n\n- How much am I covered for with Debt Protection? Are there any limitations with Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nDebt Protection covers participating customers up to $50,000 in total payments and up to $1,000 in monthly payments for up to 6 months. Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence.\n\n\n\nAs an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.\n\n\n\nPlease note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current.\n\n- Is Debt Protection considered an insurance product? How does Debt Protection work? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nNo, Debt Protection is not an insurance protection. Anyone who elects to join will sign an addendum to their loan agreement with Aven. In the event of involuntary job loss, Aven will cancel up to six months of a borrower\u2019s monthly payments per occurrence of job loss if the claim is approved.\n\n\n\nAven maintains a contractual liability policy and administrative services agreement with Securian Financial. In the event of a Debt Protection claim, Securian would approve it and reimburse funds to Aven Financial.\n\n- Who is eligible for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIn order to qualify, you must:\n\n\n- Be under 70 years old\n- Actively work a minimum of 24 hours per week\n- Not be self-employed\n\n- What is Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nFor a small monthly fee, you can protect yourself and your home for up to six months per occurrence of involuntary job loss. Aven makes no money from this offering - we offer it strictly for the benefit of any customers who are worried about potentially losing their home.\n\n\n\nPlease note, this product is only meant to help you manage your Aven card. Aven may still foreclose if the max monthly claim payment from debt protection is not sufficient to cover the minimum monthly payment due.

For payment estimates, please visit [https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator](https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator)\n\n- How do you compute my minimum due every month? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nFor revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan's minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. For payment estimates, please visit [https://aven.com/paymentCalculator](https://aven.com/paymentCalculator).\n\n- Is there a prepayment penalty? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThere is no a prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment. Cardholders can also find more details about their Account Agreement, here [https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails](https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails)\n\nImportant Note: If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released. Aven is unable to waive or shorten this wait period.\n\n- How is interest calculated on the Aven account? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nInterest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type.\n\n\n- For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase.\n- For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed.\n- Any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation.\n\nIn addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal.\n\nIf an account has zero balance in any cycle, there will be no payment due for that cycle.\n\n- When is the monthly payment due? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nStatements are generated each month close to the monthly anniversary of when cardholders signed up for an Aven account. Payment due dates are highlighted in the statement as well as in the Aven Card app. Statements are available on the Aven app and online: [https://my.aven.com/statements](https://my.aven.com/statements)\n\n- How can I make a payment on my monthly statement? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven cardholders can pay their Aven bill using the Aven Card\u00a0 app. Please note that Aven does not accept checks or cash by mail.

Your Cardholder agreement will specify the Index used for your account.\n\n\n\nWall Street Journal Prime (WSJ Prime): The Wall Street Journal surveys some of the country's biggest banks and publishes a consensus rate based on the survey. This is one of the most common indicies used for many lending products. Look up the latest rates on the [website of the Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/moneyrates). https://www.wsj.com/market-data/bonds/moneyrates\n\n\n\nFederal Funds Target Rate - Upper Limit (FFTR-UL): This rate is set by the Open Market Committee of the US Federal Reserve (FOMC). It is the short-term interest rate at which U.S. Banks and Credit Unions lend to each other overnight within the Federal Reserve system. Look up the latest rates on the [website of the St. Louis Fed](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=QGiM). [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=QGiM](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=QGiM)\n\n\n\nThe rate on your account is the sum of the index and the margin. Both can be found in your Account Agreement.\n\n- Do you give a HUD-1? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\n\n\nThere is no HUD-1 form associated with the Aven Home Card.

For each billing cycle, we add the interest bearing balance on each day of the cycle and divide it by the number of days in the cycle to get the Average Daily Balance for the billing cycle. We then calculate interest on this balance for the duration of the billing cycle, using the rate in effect on the last day of the billing cycle. Cardholders can find the rate used for the cycle on their statement in the \"Plan Summary\" section towards the end.\n\nFor fixed monthly payment plans, amount, term, and other details are presented and disclosed at the time of plan creation.

An email notifying you of the form and containing a link to the document was sent out on Jan 31, 2025. You can also view and download previous year Form 1098s at the same location in your \"Documents\".\n\nBox 1 of the Form 1098 contains the total interest you paid during 2024. To be included in this Box, the interest must have been actually paid between Jan 01, 2024 and Dec 31, 2024. If you got a statement in Dec 2024 which you paid in Jan 2025, that amount will not be included in the Form 1098 for 2024.\n\nBox 2 of the Form 1098 contains the total principal that you had on Jan 01, 2024 and any additional draws or purchases you took during the year, up through Dec 31, 2024. This amount is not the current principal on your account. You will see an amount here even if your account was paid off and closed during 2024. This amount is for IRS Reporting purposes, you total amount owed may be different.\n\nPlease consult tax rules or a tax advisor to determine whether your interest payments are tax deductible.\n\n- Why is the pending transaction amount different from the purchase? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nMerchants such as gas stations or restaurants usually request an authorization for an estimated amount before completing the transaction with the final amount. The same applies with pre-authorizations for hotel or car rentals.\n\n- How long does it take to get my card? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThe Aven card generally arrives within 7 business days from the time your account was opened.

If the person on the receiving end becomes a cardholder using the PIF link sent to them, they receive statement credit which they have the option of sharing with the person who sent them the original PIF link.\n\n- How do cardholders increase their credit limits? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven offers limited 'invitation-only' credit limit offers. Aven will notify cardholders via email or phone if their account is eligible.

Balance Transfers and Cash Outs are not eligible for cashback rewards.\n\nThey can redeem points from the reward redemption page of the app. Once rewards are redeemed they will show up as statement credit. Please note - cashback rewards cannot be used to meet the minimum payment due. Cardholders need to make a payment for the minimum due. Once the minimum due has been paid, cashback rewards will count as an additional credit and will reduce the balance on the account.\u00a0 [https://my.aven.com/rewards](https://my.aven.com/rewards)\n\n- How does someone close their Aven account? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIf cardholders wish to close their account, a payoff letter should be sent to [support@aven.com](mailto:support@aven.com). Once balances are paid Aven will process liens and close the account. Payments using ACH on the app can delay this process significantly, therefore, please request a payoff to [support@aven.com](mailto:support@aven.com).\n\n\nSHOW MORE\n\n##### Online Notary\n\n- Why do I need to sign a Power of Attorney (POA)? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIt is customary in real estate financing related transactions to require a borrower to sign a limited Power of Attorney (POA), which expires after 120 days of signing. This POA is only used for correcting minor typographical or grammatical errors, misspellings, or clerical errors. It specifically prohibits changes to rates, amounts.\n\n- How do notary sessions work? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThe Aven Card is a Home Equity Line of Credit and requires document signing with a notary. Notary sessions are conducted fully online. All signers will have their own signing session. The signer needs to have their original, unexpired government issued photo ID, a mobile phone with a working video camera, microphone, and high speed internet.\n\n- Who needs to sign the agreements? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAll applicants need to sign the Account Agreement, Deed of Trust, Power of Attorney, and notice of right to cancel. All property owners and spouses need to sign the deed of trust and notice of right to cancel as a non-borrowing signer, applicable in all states as per Aven policy. Aven does not accept POAs for signatures, except for active duty personnel who are deployed overseas with a military POA.\n\n- My ID has expired. What can I do to complete the notarization process? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nTo complete the notary session, applicants need to have their original, unexpired identification document, such as Driver's License, Passport Book, Passport Card, etc. If an ID is expired or damaged, the applicant must obtain a valid ID before the notary session.\n\n- How long does someone have to complete the notarization after applying? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nApplicants have 30 calendar days from beginning the application to accept an offer, if given. In addition, applicants have 30 calendar days from accepting their offer to completing the notarization session.\n\n- How can someone complete a notary session if an additional signer is not available at the same time or is in a different place? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThis is not an issue. Aven's notary system can easily schedule two separate notary appointments.\n\n\nSHOW MORE\n\n##### Debt Protection\n\n- Does Aven make any money from Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nNo, Aven does not make any money from this product. We offer it solely to provide our customers with peace of mind when using their home equity. The costs charged are passed directly through from Securian Financial, who serves as our contractual liability policy partner and our plan administrator.\n\n- I have a joint account. What happens if only one of us loses their job while we are enrolled in Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIf either of the co-borrowers experiences involuntary unemployment, the account will be covered for the coverage listed above.\n\n- What happens if I don\u2019t pay the Debt Protection fee? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIf you don\u2019t pay your Debt Protection fees, the loan addendum will be considered lapsed and you will not be eligible to file a claim in the event of involuntary unemployment. Even if you are not able to pay your minimum monthly payment for Aven, as long as you pay your Debt Protection fees, you will be eligible to file a claim.\n\n- Can I appeal a claim decision for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThere is no option to appeal at this time. Securian's claim decision is final.\n\n- Do I need to be current on my account to file a Debt Protection claim? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nNo. You may file a claim even if you are delinquent. However, you will need to remit the Debt Protection fees owed in order to process the claim. The cardholder has active coverage if the protection has not lapsed. Please note, if a claim is successful, it will not bring your account current.\n\n- Are there any exclusions to filing a claim for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nDebt protection is not possible in the following cases:\n\n\n- A customer retires, quits, or resigns\n- A claim occurs in first 90 days of issuance\n- A claim occurs on or after 70th birthday\n\n- How do I file a claim for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nEmail us at support@aven.com or go to the Debt Protection tab located in the sidebar menu of your Aven mobile application.\n\nThere you will see a link to file a claim. You will be routed to Securian Financial - our claims administrator - to provide details related to your job loss event and submit documentation.\n\nOnce a decision has been made, Securian Financial will notify you and Aven and issue a payment to Aven under the contractual liability policy. Please note that the cancellation date would be effective as of the date of unemployment.\n\n- How are Debt Protection fees calculated? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThe monthly rate charged is $0.92 per $1,000 of balances for single accounts and $1.75 per $1,000 of balances for joint accounts.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you have $30,000 of outstanding balances at your statement date, you would see a $27.60 charge as a single account holder and a $52.50 charge as a joint account holder in the following statement. Fees are always paid for balances in arrears.\n\n\n\nThis fee will show up on your monthly statement as a separate charge. As long as you are current on paying these fees, you will be able to file a claim in the event of involuntary job loss.\n\n- How much am I covered for with Debt Protection? Are there any limitations with Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nDebt Protection covers participating customers up to $50,000 in total payments and up to $1,000 in monthly payments for up to 6 months. Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence.\n\n\n\nAs an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.\n\n\n\nPlease note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current.\n\n- Is Debt Protection considered an insurance product? How does Debt Protection work? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nNo, Debt Protection is not an insurance protection. Anyone who elects to join will sign an addendum to their loan agreement with Aven. In the event of involuntary job loss, Aven will cancel up to six months of a borrower\u2019s monthly payments per occurrence of job loss if the claim is approved.\n\n\n\nAven maintains a contractual liability policy and administrative services agreement with Securian Financial. In the event of a Debt Protection claim, Securian would approve it and reimburse funds to Aven Financial.\n\n- Who is eligible for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIn order to qualify, you must:\n\n\n- Be under 70 years old\n- Actively work a minimum of 24 hours per week\n- Not be self-employed\n\n- What is Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nFor a small monthly fee, you can protect yourself and your home for up to six months per occurrence of involuntary job loss. Aven makes no money from this offering - we offer it strictly for the benefit of any customers who are worried about potentially losing their home.\n\n\n\nPlease note, this product is only meant to help you manage your Aven card. Aven may still foreclose if the max monthly claim payment from debt protection is not sufficient to cover the minimum monthly payment due. Additionally, your first lien holder may still foreclose if you fall into default on mortgage payments.\n\n\nSHOW MORE\n\n##### Can't find what you need?\n\nSearch question, keywords, or

They emailed me today that they canceled the card and deleted the account tradelines from your credit report and requested Experian to reverse the hard inquiry.\u00a0So while it\u2019s definitely really scammy what they did, at least they took care of it quickly.\n\n0\n\nReply\n\n![joe](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/62cdc6936e6d71c92931fb2ba8c7823a?s=128&d=mm&r=g)\n\njoe\u00a0(@guest\\_2022396)\n\nMarch 13, 2025 18:43\n\n#2022396\n\n[Matt](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/aven-free-5-weekly-starbucks-giftcard-if-you-have-700-vantage-4-0-credit-score-homeownert/#comment-2022263)\n\nGlad they got that fixed for you quickly as well.

First batch went out shortly after this was posted on DoC, but I was starting to wonder about second batch and did get texts finally on Friday.

    "text": "Now that you understand what a HELOC Card is, let\u2019s dive into how it works. This article also explains where you can use your card and how it differs from the credit cards in your wallet. How to get a HELOC Card To use a traditional HELOC, you typically need to transfer funds to a checking account before making purchases or use special checks issued to you by the lender. This process can be complicated, time-consuming and frustrating. Some lenders will instead give you a HELOC Card to use at your convenience so you can access your funds immediately. However, there are several requirements to be eligible to apply, including: proving you have a steady income, being listed on your home\u2019s title, having a certain credit score and possessing a valid ID. If you meet the requirements, the application process typically looks something like this: Complete the online application, which asks questions about yourself and your home Verify your income by providing pay stubs or a company verification letter Meet with a notary to sign required documents Receive your card within a few business days Where can HELOC funds be used? Once your card arrives in the mail, you can start making purchases with it right away. You can use your card at any merchant that accepts major credit cards, like Visa and MasterCard. Experts recommend using a HELOC Card for purchases that help increase wealth over the long run. For example, many homeowners tend to use their funds on home improvements or remodeling, which can significantly increase the property\u2019s value. You can also use the card to transfer balances from personal loans or other credit cards. While there are no restrictions on what products or services you can purchase with a HELOC Card, financial advisors typically advise against using your card on frivolous items or experiences, such as vacations or a new car, which are unlikely to increase your wealth. These types of purchases could even make it harder to pay off your HELOC balance in the future. How to pay for charges made on a HELOC Card Every month, you will receive a statement with your charges, much like you do with a traditional credit card. The monthly bill for a HELOC Card from Aven, for example, consists of 1% of the principal balance plus finance and interest charges on the average daily balance during your last billing cycle. If you choose to pay only your minimum balance each month, it can take you a very long time to pay your balance back. You can choose to pay more than the minimum or to make payments more often than once a month if you'd like to pay down your debt sooner. If you can't pay your monthly bill on time, you will likely incur a late fee. How is a HELOC Card different from a credit card? While a HELOC Card is used in a similar way as a regular credit card, they are not the same. The main difference is that a HELOC Card uses your home\u2019s equity to secure the loan, while a credit card doesn\u2019t require any collateral. Consequently, HELOC Cards have much lower interest rates than credit cards. However, unlike with a credit card, the rate is usually variable, meaning it moves up and down based on a benchmark rate. Are you looking for a HELOC Card? Aven is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back. Aven is the world's first home equity-backed credit card and combines the low interest rates of a home equity line of credit with the flexibility of a credit card. Click here to learn more!",

    "text": "[Skip to content](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#primary)\n\nAven has already shaken up the home lending industry with its groundbreaking equity-backed credit card. Now, it\u2019s offering a new product called **AvenCash**, a more traditional home equity line of credit (HELOC).\n\nAvenCash is ideal for homeowners looking for a HELOC that blends familiarity with innovation. It\u2019s also ideal for applicants with **credit scores of 720 and higher**. Despite the stated minimum credit score of 640, we\u2019ve observed that applicants with scores below 720 have a much lower chance of being approved and are better off [seeking alternatives to HELOCs](https://lendedu.com/blog/home-equity-loans-lines-of-credit-alternatives/) in general.\n\n![Aven logo](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Aven-logo-e1727891899813.png)\n\nBest customer reviews\n\n4.8 /5\n\n[View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/l5jxbby19yz1xjgv5e/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end)\n\nHELOC\n\n- Offers lowest rate guarantee\n- Optional debt protection program through Securian\n- Approval in as little as 15 minutes\n- Excellent customer reviews from more than 3,800 customers\n- 100% digital application process\n- Increases the credit line for select customers\n- Automated appraisals\n- High maximum loan-to-value ratio (LTV)\n- Three-day funding after signing\n- Fixed interest rates from start to finish\n- Check your rate with no credit impact\n\n- Short draw period\n- First-draw fee of 4.90%\n- Only available in 32 states\\*\n\n| | |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Rates (APR)** | 6.99% \u2013 15.49% |\n| **Loan amounts** | $5,000 \u2013 $400,000 |\n| **Repayment terms** | 5, 10, 15, or 30 years |\n| **Min. credit score** | 640 |\n| **Funding time** | As little as 3 days after signing |\n\n\\*Not currently available in Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia\n\nKeep reading to see how an Aven HELOC uses technology to make borrowing simpler and faster\u2014and to decide if it\u2019s right for you.\n\nTable of Contents Skip to Section\n\n- [How an Aven HELOC works](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#how)\n- [Draws and repayment](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#draw)\n- [Unique benefits](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#benefits)\n- [More about Aven HELOCs](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#eligible)\n\n## Aven HELOC at a glance\n\nAvenCash offers competitive rates, flexible repayment terms, and a generous maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Here\u2019s a closer look at the Aven HELOC highlights.\n\n| **Terms** | **Details** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rates (APR) | 6.99% \u2013 15.49% fixed |\n| HELOC amounts | $5,000 \u2013 $400,000 |\n| Minimum draw amount | Full HELOC amount |\n| Draw period | 5 years |\n| Term lengths | 5, 10, 15, or 30 years |\n| Origination (first-draw) fee | 4.90% |\n| Application fee | $0 |\n| Minimum credit score | 640 |\n| Max loan-to-value ratio | 89% |\n| Unique features | Automated appraisals; lowest rate guarantee; debt protection program; credit line increases for select customers |\n\n## How does an Aven HELOC work?\n\nAvenCash combines tech-infused applications and appraisals with borrower-friendly features that rival what you\u2019ll find with competing [home equity companies](https://lendedu.com/blog/list-of-home-equity-companies/). These features include:\n\n- **Instant prequalification**: Aven begins every application with an initial screening. You\u2019ll know within seconds if you\u2019re preapproved, and go from application all the way to closing in 15 minutes.\n- **Automatic income verification**: Aven uses a variety of sources to automatically verify your income, which makes the process quick and easy. Some customers may be asked to connect your bank account or manually upload proof of income.\n- **No property restrictions**: Primary residence? No problem. Investment property? Bring it on. New build? That\u2019s fine, too. Aven considers every property, even those held in a trust.\n- **Minimal insurance requirements**: Aven doesn\u2019t require proof of insurance unless your home is in a flood zone or your credit line is more than $100,000.\n- **Digital appraisals and notarization:** You can complete the entire HELOC process from a phone or computer. Aven uses automated valuation models (AVMs), which rely on recent sale information, current-year tax assessments, and other data to [determine your home value](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-is-home-value-determined-for-heloc/), and its online notaries help you close on your HELOC 100% online. No signing of paper docs is needed.\n- **Fast funding**: You can start using your HELOC three business days after signing.\n\nIn addition, **all AvenCash HELOCs come with fixed rates**. While some lenders let you convert variable rates to fixed rates, only a few offer fixed rates for your entire term. Fixed rates provide stability and predictability in your monthly payment\u2014it won\u2019t fluctuate unless you withdraw additional funds or pay down your outstanding balance.\n\n![](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/plugins/lendeducom-gutenberg-blocks/src/assets/img/readmore.svg)\n\nRead More\n\n[What is a home equity line of credit?](https://lendedu.com/blog/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit/)\n\n## How do you draw from and repay an Aven HELOC?\n\nAven lets you [pull from your HELOC](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-does-draw-period-work-on-heloc/) as often as you need over five years. However, it\u2019s important to note that Aven requires you to draw the full HELOC amount at origination.\n\nSo, while you can redraw from your line anytime during the five-year draw period, you\u2019ll need to repay some of the balance to free up funds before making additional withdrawals.\n\nOnce you enter [HELOC repayment](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-does-heloc-repayment-work/), Aven allows you to customize your repayment period anywhere from five to 30 years to pay off your credit line.\n\n## Do Aven HELOCs come with any unique borrower benefits?\n\nIn addition to the features and rates that make Aven\u2019s HELOC a solid competitor in the home equity marketplace, the company offers some unique benefits that we find valuable for HELOC borrowers. These include:\n\n- **Lowest rate guarantee:** If you qualify with other HELOC lenders and can get a lower rate elsewhere, let Aven know, and it will beat the offer or send you $100.\n- **Refinancing available:** Homeowners with a second lien (like an existing HELOC or [home equity loan](https://lendedu.com/blog/what-is-a-home-equity-loan/)) can refinance it into an Aven HELOC. There are no origination fees or transfer fees to refinance.\n- **Automatic credit line increases:** If you make on-time payments and/or your home equity increases, Aven will automatically invite you for a credit line increase.\n- **Debt protection through Securian:** Aven offers a unique program in which borrowers can pay a monthly fee ranging from $0.92 to $1.75 per $1,000 of HELOC balance\u2014up to $50,000. If you become involuntarily unemployed (meaning you are laid off or let go from your job), Securian will cover six months of minimum payments up to $1,000 per month.\n\n## Who\u2019s eligible for an Aven HELOC?\n\nQualifying for an Aven HELOC hinges primarily on your [credit score](https://lendedu.com/blog/credit-score-needed-home-equity-loans/), built-up equity, and location.\n\nAs with most lenders, Aven needs to see that you can handle additional debt and that your home\u2019s value will hold steady until that debt is repaid.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Aven accepts joint applications, which could be helpful if you apply with a spouse, for example, with a higher credit score.\n\nAven doesn\u2019t lend in every state, however. Here are Aven\u2019s eligibility criteria and residency requirements in greater detail:\n\n| **Requirements** | **Details** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Eligible properties | Primary residences and investment properties |\n| State of residence | Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming |\n| Maximum loan-to-value (LTV) | 89% |\n| Maximum debt-to-income | Not disclosed |\n| Minimum credit score | 640 |\n| Minimum income | Not disclosed |\n\n## What are the costs and fees of an Aven HELOC?\n\nYou won\u2019t pay many fees with Aven, but its HELOC isn\u2019t entirely fee-free. **While Aven doesn\u2019t charge application or appraisal fees, it does levy a 4.90% first-draw fee, which is essentially an origination fee**. Aven also assesses a $29 late fee on its home equity card, though it\u2019s unclear if this applies to AvenCash.\n\nHowever, fees are only one piece of the HELOC affordability puzzle. These fees work in tandem with your interest rate to create your annual percentage rate (APR). Your APR reflects the true premium you pay for your credit line, so locking in the lowest possible APR is imperative.\n\nTo better illustrate how APR can influence your borrowing cost, let\u2019s say that you withdraw $50,000 from your HELOC at an 11% APR. Here\u2019s how much your HELOC would cost over time:\n\n![Infographic showing how APR can influence borrowing cost.](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcb25g1LtEo-kbiI6k7EzoIkL0_SJOwQTyjQ-kVI25QaZfTk9d4u22Gf1JuvxwlmaJolZXGNFSJIJa7wEJ9g0pCa3zIeq2R2APXFvLhs7UQ9PAsE4_Pe8d6dvm-FtpKYgpVR9KetxA6NAe2ra9_FZ0-Nlo?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nWhat started as a $50,000 balance ballooned into a six-figure price tag because of your 11% APR. But what if you held out for a better rate and qualified for a 9% APR instead? How might that change your payments and overall borrowing cost?\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe5uFidA5GimocFg2duH_EjR8H1VydxvXSTen9tXS9JhKawHYYJPw59-qBmV5XTkoGCtBgesakhAPOz47jbNqEt2lyAiRl5f3bSKlyWK3NQ0_skxu9bMFNjVioskgX4FVXifVgLH8msS_iBSwgg4T9ohlo?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nIf we look just at your monthly payments, particularly your payments once your draw period ends, it\u2019s easy to miss how influential your APR really is.\n\nHowever, we can see your APR\u2019s cumulative impact when we zoom out. Not only are your monthly payments more affordable at the lower rate, but you\u2019ve also saved $11,531 over the life of your HELOC.\n\n## How does your home\u2019s value affect your terms?\n\nIn addition to your credit score, Aven\u2019s automated underwriting process also\u00a0[factors in your home equity](https://www.aven.com/support/article/360061758811#:~:text=an%20applicant%27s%20income%2C-,equity,-%2C%20credit%2C%20and%20debt)\u00a0and, by extension, your home\u2019s value. Generally speaking, **lower home values and lower equity translate to lower credit limits, higher rates, or both**.\n\nThis is where LTV comes into play. This ratio compares what you owe on your home to what it\u2019s worth. Aven accepts up to an 89% LTV, so your combined home-secured debt can\u2019t exceed 89% of your home\u2019s value.\n\nThat home-secured debt includes any existing financing, like your mortgage, as well as your new HELOC. Say, for instance, that you owe $150,000 on a $300,000 home. Here\u2019s how Aven might calculate [how much you can borrow with a HELOC](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-much-can-i-borrow-on-heloc/) in light of its LTV threshold:\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf8laOyBZE4hyFaQjraHA0UXi07mLGHaRsM_J8Iwi5FjB-bJ9qiyKU1SMadNcicL6s8UF5oV9gQfMWYhwhdCyRV0vWypKluLfrbPhgulFnmIIsItqw4H5jz-RXbxysOJCxuzcX7PHtKQPMQZdfm3estd1g?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nBut what if Aven determined your home value to be slightly higher? Take a look below to see how much more you could borrow if your home appraised at $325,000 instead:\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdkkXz_Rr33A4nn6_basjCc-E7EIuCDb_-K-KH48e3wkeyF18o-2lU3TICaBZcXS-hZ6rWZG8EMoQS0Vo68dCePXyy_jcxJmNYIr8zZrRiBCK_2GP_5F0v-5_sHNOqX09krx-rxDln9ev3p1Sfly6_7w3YC?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nIn our first example, $117,000 was the largest HELOC you could get without surpassing the 89% cap. With the increased property value in our second example, your potential HELOC limit went up by $22,250.\n\nBefore you rush to remodel your kitchen, we should mention that virtual appraisals don\u2019t always capture improvements like these. That\u2019s because these appraisals rely on tax data and recent selling prices of nearby homes, not necessarily a physical examination of your property.\n\nRather than investing in renovations you weren\u2019t otherwise planning, you may see better results\u2014both to your HELOC limit and your long-term financial position\u2014by reducing your mortgage balance instead.\n\n## Pros & cons of Aven HELOCs\n\nPros\n\n- High maximum LTV\n\nAven\u2019s 89% LTV threshold makes its HELOC more accessible to more homeowners. It also means you could open a larger HELOC than you\u2019d qualify for elsewhere.\n\n- Fixed rates\n\nWith Aven, your HELOC rate will never change, so you\u2019ll know what to expect month after month.\n\n- Few fees\n\nUnlike some of its competitors, Aven doesn\u2019t charge application, appraisal, or notary fees. You won\u2019t pay an annual fee, either.\n\n- Customizable repayment options\n\nAven offers four different repayment periods, and you can choose the term that best suits your finances.\n\n- Completely virtual application and appraisal\n\nYou\u2019ll forego the time and hassle of scheduling a traditional appraisal with Aven. You could apply and get approved in as little as 15 minutes.\n\n- Unique borrower benefits\n\nFrom its lowest rate guarantee to its debt protection program, Aven offers borrowers unique benefits you can\u2019t find with other lenders.\n\n\nCons\n\n- Virtual appraisals aren\u2019t always accurate\n\nWhile convenient, automated appraisals aren\u2019t as thorough as in-person valuations. Because it can\u2019t catch everything, Aven\u2019s system might undervalue your home.\n\n- Not available everywhere\n\nAven only lends in 32 states, rendering many homeowners ineligible for its HELOC.\n\n- Limited draw period\n\nAven\u2019s draw period is considerably shorter than what you might get with another lender, which is only five years.\n\n- Full amount is drawn at origination\n\nAven requires borrowers to draw their entire HELOC amount initially, meaning you must repay some of the balance within that five-year draw period to redraw funds as needed.\n\n- No introductory rates or rate discounts\n\nSome HELOC companies offer perks like a reduced rate for your first 12 months or when you sign up for autopay. Aven, however, isn\u2019t one of them.\n\n\n## Is Aven a reputable lender?\n\n**Aven\u2019s thousands of positive Trustpilot reviews and an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) certainly lend the company credibility**.\n\nWhile most of Aven\u2019s existing reviews center on its HELOC card, we can use those reviews to infer the service quality you\u2019ll experience with its traditional HELOC. Here\u2019s a closer look at how past customers rate the lender:\n\n| | | |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Source | Customer rating | Number of reviews |\n| Trustpilot | 4.9 stars | 3,811 |\n| Better Business Bureau | 1 star | 7 |\n\nCollected on August 30, 2024.\n\nDespite the one-star customer rating on the site, we consider Aven\u2019s A+ rating from the BBB a significant endorsement of its reliability. With a limited sample size of just seven reviews, we weigh those reviews less heavily than the 3,793 reviews on Trustpilot, where Aven boasts an impressive 4.9-star rating.\n\nThe combination of an A+ BBB rating and the overwhelmingly positive Trustpilot feedback is what led us to designate Aven\u2019s HELOC as the best for customer reviews.\n\nEfficiency and clear communication are common threads throughout Aven\u2019s Trustpilot reviews. Many borrowers applaud the company\u2019s quick application process and speak highly of its customer support team.\n\nOf course, no lender is perfect. Aven\u2019s lowest ratings come from customers frustrated by a lack of clear communication. One reviewer reported getting mixed messages regarding their approval, while another shared that their HELOC card was frozen unexpectedly.\n\n## Does Aven have a customer service team?\n\nWhether you\u2019re seeking general information or have a specific question, Aven\u2019s team is ready to help. The San Francisco-based company offers multiple ways to get in touch:\n\n- **Email**: Connect with the Aven team by emailing [\\[email\u00a0protected\\]](https://lendedu.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cebdbbbebea1bcba8eafb8aba0e0ada1a3).\n- **Contact form**: Send a message to Aven\u2019s representatives directly from the website.\n- **Phone**: Call Aven at [415-582-6613](tel:415-582-6613) to leave a voice message. Alternatively, you can [schedule a callback](https://aven.com/call) online.\n\nAven doesn\u2019t list its hours of operation, and it encourages homeowners to use email for faster communication. If you prefer to speak with a live human, consider scheduling a callback instead.\n\n## How to apply for an Aven HELOC\n\nAven\u2019s tech-powered HELOC application process is just as innovative as its product offerings. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. **Enter your phone number to start the application**. Alternatively, you can enter your Aven invite code if you have one.\n2. **Tell Aven how much you need to borrow**. You\u2019ll also tell Aven how you plan to use your credit line.\n3. **Provide your contact details and identifying information**. This includes your date of birth and the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you\u2019re applying with another person, you\u2019ll also enter their information.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdQq2Yj2vKOqDLmkbC6JpgpyyfL_WskxdA-bpUX6BFu3Gypl81WFEdW6KMFusEurKGSRp6wRsTiiWKDULDXHBhHcbK97e9ZPtIfTYJr5_beqx_DxSe0uiNwP1RvyE2Kd1FjozDb8d3fqpg88yYCDUyv4vFO?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\n1. **View your prequalified offers**. At this stage, you haven\u2019t consented to a hard credit pull. You\u2019re simply getting Aven\u2019s preliminary approval and choosing the potential HELOC terms that work best for you.\n2. **Verify your income**. Aven automatically verifies the majority of its customers\u2019 income when you apply. Some customers may be asked to either link your bank account with Plaid or send in documents like W-2s or 1099s for manual review.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeopdNOh-WyLQpZnRlNj2Z6Dzty5zTxtkvyPkQXTk-DbS8e8iGxhurP4nsMgKi5EuBbF9x97CNy07K5gJp23a0JY619tsxwxHwlTdXr1h4pJjzVD29gKtZwkeq-ocl75OWwCLpfKd2ZTyK7iRweZ1lyBkw?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\n1. **Submit your application**.Now, you\u2019ll give Aven permission to run your credit and present you with a final HELOC offer.\n2. **Schedule your notary session**. If approved, Aven will connect you with an online notary to review and sign your documents.\n\nAfter reading your HELOC agreement, prepare to hang tight through the mandatory [three-day waiting period](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/home-equity-loans-and-home-equity-lines-credit#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Three%2DDay,cancel%20the%20deal%20without%20penalty.). As soon as this window passes, Aven will fund your HELOC, and you\u2019ll have access to your new credit line.\n\n## Aven HELOC alternatives\n\nFor many homeowners, Aven may be the clear winner, and for good reason. Still, it\u2019s wise to consider your options before committing to a lender. Here are three of the [best HELOC lenders](https://lendedu.com/blog/home-equity-line-of-credit/) available:\n\n| **Company** | **Best for\u2026** | **Rating**(0-5) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Figure logo](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/figure_refi.png) 4.9 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/figure-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best overall | 4.9 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/figure-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\n| ![](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/FourLeaf_logo_EHL-NMLS_FCU-1.png) 4.7 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/bethpage-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best for large HELOCs | 4.7 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/bethpage-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\n| ![lendingtree logo](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lendingtree-logo.png) 4.5 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/lendingtree-heloc-heloc/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best for comparison shopping | 4.5 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/lendingtree-heloc-heloc/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\n\nWhile these companies share commonalities with Aven, each one offers distinct advantages that Aven doesn\u2019t:\n\n- [**Figure**](https://lendedu.com/blog/figure-home-equity-loan-review/) is available in more states. It also allows LTVs up to 95%.\n- [**FourLeaf**](https://lendedu.com/blog/bethpage-home-equity-review/) boasts a 10-year draw period and HELOCs up to $1 million.\n- [**LendingTree**](https://lendedu.com/blog/lendingtree-home-equity-loans-review/) shows you multiple prequalified offers in one place.\n\nThose prequalified offers are key to choosing the right lender. They tell you instantly which companies can give you the HELOC you\u2019re looking for and which ones can\u2019t.\n\nSince prequalifying doesn\u2019t hurt your credit, we recommend checking your rates with at least four lenders. Compare each offer, paying close attention to APRs, credit limits, and term lengths.\n\nIt may be tempting to accept the first HELOC offer you get. But by slowing down and carefully evaluating your options, you\u2019ll boost your odds of locking in not just any HELOC but a HELOC that\u2019s virtually tailor-made for you.\n\n## How we rated Aven\n\nWe designed LendEDU\u2019s editorial rating system to help readers find companies that offer the best HELOCs. Our system awards higher ratings to companies with affordable solutions, positive customer reviews, and online transparency of benefits and terms.\n\nWe compared Aven to several home equity lenders, using hundreds of data points from company websites, public disclosures, customer reviews, and direct communication with company representatives. We weighted, scored, and combined each factor to produce a final editorial rating. This rating is expressed on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest possible score.

While certainly convenient, the card is best suited for highly responsible borrowers, as it\u2019s easy to lose track of how much equity you\u2019re tapping (and how much debt your home is serving as collateral for). Aven also offers a fully online experience, which is fine for the tech-savvy. But some borrowers might miss the option of in-person assistance.\n\n## Aven home equity loan overview\n\nAven was founded in 2019 by former executives from Facebook and Square. Its first product, the Aven Home Card, launched in 2022. Since its inception, Aven has issued over $1.5 billion in credit lines via the card. The fast-growing fintech company also offers a financial advisory tool, Aven Advisor.\n\nIn July 2024, Aven announced it had received a new round of $142 million in investment funding.\n\n### Aven home equity products offered\n\nAven\u2019s product isn\u2019t a typical home equity line of credit (HELOC) or HE loan; it\u2019s a credit card. You\u2019ll get a line of credit based on your tappable home equity, like a HELOC, and receive unlimited 2 percent cash back on purchases, like a cash-back reward credit card.\n\nThe card is a Visa card and backed by Coastal Community Bank, an FDIC-insured institution. Along with individual purchases, you can use the Aven HELOC card to cash out your home equity in large amounts, with the funds going directly into your designated bank account. You have the option to repay the funds in fixed installments over five or 10 years, similar to a home equity loan (\u201cAven Simple Loan\u201d).\n\nAven also offers a HELOC refinance product, in which users can refinance their existing second -lien HELOC or home equity loan to an Aven HELOC. There are no origination or transfer fees associated with the refinance.\n\n## Pros and cons of Aven\n\n### Pros\n\n- Checkmark Icon\n\nNo annual, origination, appraisal, notary or pre-payment fees.\n\n- Checkmark Icon\n\nYou can be approved in as fast as 15 minutes.\n\n- Checkmark Icon\n\nUnique product that provides a convenient way to tap equity for both big draws and small purchases.\n\n\n### Cons\n\n- Aven charges a 2.5 percent fee on balance transfers and cash-outs.\n\n- Not available in all states. Line of credit size is limited in 15 states.\n\n- Convenience of the card could encourage irresponsible use of home equity.\n\n\n## How Bankrate scored Aven\n\n### Affordability: 5/5\n\n- **APR:** Aven now provides a lowest rate guarantee. If you're able to get a lower HELOC rate with another lender, it will beat the offer or send you $100. Its APRs for primary residences run between 7.74% and 15.24% (depending on your credit) \u2014 low compared to most credit cards. Also, Aven\u2019s maximum APR won\u2019t exceed 18 percent during the life of your account.\n- **Fees:**\u00a0There are no annual, sign-up, or prepayment fees, but you\u2019ll pay a 2.5% fee on cash outs and balance transfers. You will also be on the hook for a $29 late fee if you miss the minimum payment.\n\nThe absence of fees, competitive APRs and the lowest rate guarantee all help Aven score a 5 out of 5 affordability rating.\n\n### Availability:\u00a0 4.9/5\n\n- **Credit score**: You will need a FICO score and VantageScore of at least 640, which is typical of home equity lenders.\n- **Loan products**: Aven\u2019s credit card allows you to tap into your home equity while offering cash rewards. All purchases you make with the Aven card will earn you unlimited 2 percent cash back.\n- **Where to find it:**\u00a0Aven is available in most U.S. states except Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. The company has a goal of reaching all 50 states by 2025.\n\nAven scores 4.9 out of 5 for availability due to its unique home equity credit card, ability to earn 2 percent cash back and its reach across the majority of states in the U.S.\n\n### Borrower experience: 4.0/5\n\n- **Rate transparency:** While you won\u2019t see your APR until you receive your offer, Aven only performs a \u201csoft pull\u201d on your credit report, which doesn\u2019t affect your credit score. (If you do accept the offer, a hard inquiry follows, which can temporarily impact your score.)\n- **Convenience:** Borrowers can use their Aven card to purchase anything wherever Visa cards are accepted. However, it can\u2019t be used for cash withdrawals from an ATM or bank.\n- **Customer service:** The application process can be completed completely online and if you need support, Aven is reachable by phone, email, online form, online chat and text message.\n\nBorrowers can use their card for purchases everywhere Visa is accepted and they offer multiple support options, giving Aven a 4 out of 5 for borrower experience.\n\n## Aven\u2019s reputation\n\nWhile it\u2019s a relative newcomer in the home equity lending space, Aven gets a 4.9 out of 5 review on Trustpilot.\n\n### What consumers say about Aven\n\nDespite a few digs about \u201cdelayed response times,\u201d customer reviews are largely glowing for Aven on Bankrate, especially for the \u201cfast,\u201d \u201csimple\u201d application process: \u201cSo easy to do, it's a no brainer for homeowners.\u201d\n\n## How to qualify for a HELOC card with Aven\n\nAven lets you take out as much as 89 percent of your home\u2019s equity. You will also need to have a FICO and a Vantage credit score of at least 640; customers with higher scores will get better rates.\n\nYou can get the card with equity tied to either a primary residence, second home or investment property, but the designated property can only have one mortgage attached to it at the time you apply.\n\nIf you obtain a credit line higher than $100,000, you\u2019ll also need to add Aven and Coastal Community Bank as beneficiaries on your homeowners insurance policy.\n\n## How to apply with Aven\n\nYou can apply for an Aven HELOC card on Aven\u2019s website, email them at [support@aven.com](mailto:support@aven.com) or call 415-582-6613. The application process typically takes just 15 minutes, according to the website. Checking just to see if you qualify for the card will not affect your credit score.\n\nLightbulb Icon\n\nBankrate insight\n\nYou can tap into your home equity \u2014 the difference between your home's worth and what you owe on your mortgage \u2014 with a home equity loan or a HELOC. With those funds, you can tackle a variety of expenses, like debt consolidation or home renovations.\n\nHowever, before you dive in, it's important to figure out your loan-to-value ratio (LTV). Lenders use your LTV to determine how much of your equity stake you can actually borrow. (It\u2019s typically 80 percent, although some lenders allow you to access as much as 90 percent.) The amount of equity they\u2019ll let you tap is one consideration when choosing a lender. Be it a retail bank, online lender or credit union, it may offer different [home equity loan rates](https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/get-the-best-heloc-rate/) and terms, too. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to [shop around for the best deal](https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/where-should-you-get-a-home-equity-loan/).\n\n- ### Methodology\n\nCaret Down Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine a mortgage lender\u2019s Bankrate Score, Bankrate rates lenders on a scale of one (1) to five (5) stars \u2014 with five (5) the highest rating \u2014 based on a variety of factors relating to the lender\u2019s products and services. To assign our ratings, we assessed each mortgage lender across three core areas:\n\n\n\n- Affordability: Annual percentage rate (APR) - 80%; introductory APR - 20%\n- Availability: Licensing - 50%; credit score - 20%; loan minimum - 10%; draw requirement - 10%; loan products - 10%\n- Borrower experience: Rate transparency - 35%; convenience - 35%; customer service - 20%; fixed-rate options - 10%\n\nLearn more about our [methodology](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/lender-review-methodology/).\n\n## Aven customer ratings and reviews\n\n![logo](https://www.brimg.net/system/img/inst/11841_hires_logo.png)\n\n3.2\n\nRating: 3.23 stars out of 5\n\n31 ratings\n\nStar ranking and total number reflects the lifetime customer reviews received while this lender has been an advertiser on Bankrate.

It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Percent Sign Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/rateIcon.bdf34906.svg)\n\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\n\nFor Cash Outs, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. One time 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.[4](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_4)\n\n![Calculator Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/paymentIcon.c7d44db7.svg)\n\nWhat is my monthly payment?\n\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. [See Payment Calculator](https://www.aven.com/PaymentCalculator).\n\n![Cash Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/cashIcon.12b80785.svg)\n\nCan I get cash too?\n\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Meter Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/creditScoreIcon.57152ad7.svg)\n\nDoes this affect my credit score?\n\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\n\n![Price Tag Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/feesIcon.54015658.svg)\n\nAre there any fees?\n\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don\u2019t make the minimum payment.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n##### More Questions...\n\nSearch\n\n# Become an Expert\n\n## Grow your knowledge with our educational articles written by our team of experts.\n\n[![Can you get cash from Aven card?](https://www.aven.com/img/can-you-get-cash-aven-card.b4532e86.webp)\\\n**Can you get cash from Aven card?** \\\n\\\nYes!

While certainly convenient, the card is best suited for highly responsible borrowers, as it\u2019s easy to lose track of how much equity you\u2019re tapping (and how much debt your home is serving as collateral for). Aven also offers a fully online experience, which is fine for the tech-savvy. But some borrowers might miss the option of in-person assistance.\n\n## Aven home equity loan overview\n\nAven was founded in 2019 by former executives from Facebook and Square. Its first product, the Aven Home Card, launched in 2022. Since its inception, Aven has issued over $1.5 billion in credit lines via the card. The fast-growing fintech company also offers a financial advisory tool, Aven Advisor.\n\nIn July 2024, Aven announced it had received a new round of $142 million in investment funding.\n\n### Aven home equity products offered\n\nAven\u2019s product isn\u2019t a typical home equity line of credit (HELOC) or HE loan; it\u2019s a credit card. You\u2019ll get a line of credit based on your tappable home equity, like a HELOC, and receive unlimited 2 percent cash back on purchases, like a cash-back reward credit card.\n\nThe card is a Visa card and backed by Coastal Community Bank, an FDIC-insured institution. Along with individual purchases, you can use the Aven HELOC card to cash out your home equity in large amounts, with the funds going directly into your designated bank account. You have the option to repay the funds in fixed installments over five or 10 years, similar to a home equity loan (\u201cAven Simple Loan\u201d).\n\nAven also offers a HELOC refinance product, in which users can refinance their existing second -lien HELOC or home equity loan to an Aven HELOC. There are no origination or transfer fees associated with the refinance.\n\n## Pros and cons of Aven\n\n### Pros\n\n- Checkmark Icon\n\nNo annual, origination, appraisal, notary or pre-payment fees.\n\n- Checkmark Icon\n\nYou can be approved in as fast as 15 minutes.\n\n- Checkmark Icon\n\nUnique product that provides a convenient way to tap equity for both big draws and small purchases.\n\n\n### Cons\n\n- Aven charges a 2.5 percent fee on balance transfers and cash-outs.\n\n- Not available in all states. Line of credit size is limited in 15 states.\n\n- Convenience of the card could encourage irresponsible use of home equity.\n\n\n## How Bankrate scored Aven\n\n### Affordability: 5/5\n\n- **APR:** Aven now provides a lowest rate guarantee. If you're able to get a lower HELOC rate with another lender, it will beat the offer or send you $100. Its APRs for primary residences run between 7.74% and 15.24% (depending on your credit) \u2014 low compared to most credit cards. Also, Aven\u2019s maximum APR won\u2019t exceed 18 percent during the life of your account.\n- **Fees:**\u00a0There are no annual, sign-up, or prepayment fees, but you\u2019ll pay a 2.5% fee on cash outs and balance transfers. You will also be on the hook for a $29 late fee if you miss the minimum payment.\n\nThe absence of fees, competitive APRs and the lowest rate guarantee all help Aven score a 5 out of 5 affordability rating.\n\n### Availability:\u00a0 4.9/5\n\n- **Credit score**: You will need a FICO score and VantageScore of at least 640, which is typical of home equity lenders.\n- **Loan products**: Aven\u2019s credit card allows you to tap into your home equity while offering cash rewards. All purchases you make with the Aven card will earn you unlimited 2 percent cash back.\n- **Where to find it:**\u00a0Aven is available in most U.S. states except Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. The company has a goal of reaching all 50 states by 2025.\n\nAven scores 4.9 out of 5 for availability due to its unique home equity credit card, ability to earn 2 percent cash back and its reach across the majority of states in the U.S.\n\n### Borrower experience: 4.0/5\n\n- **Rate transparency:** While you won\u2019t see your APR until you receive your offer, Aven only performs a \u201csoft pull\u201d on your credit report, which doesn\u2019t affect your credit score. (If you do accept the offer, a hard inquiry follows, which can temporarily impact your score.)\n- **Convenience:** Borrowers can use their Aven card to purchase anything wherever Visa cards are accepted. However, it can\u2019t be used for cash withdrawals from an ATM or bank.\n- **Customer service:** The application process can be completed completely online and if you need support, Aven is reachable by phone, email, online form, online chat and text message.\n\nBorrowers can use their card for purchases everywhere Visa is accepted and they offer multiple support options, giving Aven a 4 out of 5 for borrower experience.\n\n## Aven\u2019s reputation\n\nWhile it\u2019s a relative newcomer in the home equity lending space, Aven gets a 4.9 out of 5 review on Trustpilot.\n\n### What consumers say about Aven\n\nDespite a few digs about \u201cdelayed response times,\u201d customer reviews are largely glowing for Aven on Bankrate, especially for the \u201cfast,\u201d \u201csimple\u201d application process: \u201cSo easy to do, it's a no brainer for homeowners.\u201d\n\n## How to qualify for a HELOC card with Aven\n\nAven lets you take out as much as 89 percent of your home\u2019s equity. You will also need to have a FICO and a Vantage credit score of at least 640; customers with higher scores will get better rates.\n\nYou can get the card with equity tied to either a primary residence, second home or investment property, but the designated property can only have one mortgage attached to it at the time you apply.\n\nIf you obtain a credit line higher than $100,000, you\u2019ll also need to add Aven and Coastal Community Bank as beneficiaries on your homeowners insurance policy.\n\n## How to apply with Aven\n\nYou can apply for an Aven HELOC card on Aven\u2019s website, email them at [support@aven.com](mailto:support@aven.com) or call 415-582-6613. The application process typically takes just 15 minutes, according to the website. Checking just to see if you qualify for the card will not affect your credit score.\n\nLightbulb Icon\n\nBankrate insight\n\nYou can tap into your home equity \u2014 the difference between your home's worth and what you owe on your mortgage \u2014 with a home equity loan or a HELOC. With those funds, you can tackle a variety of expenses, like debt consolidation or home renovations.\n\nHowever, before you dive in, it's important to figure out your loan-to-value ratio (LTV). Lenders use your LTV to determine how much of your equity stake you can actually borrow. (It\u2019s typically 80 percent, although some lenders allow you to access as much as 90 percent.) The amount of equity they\u2019ll let you tap is one consideration when choosing a lender. Be it a retail bank, online lender or credit union, it may offer different [home equity loan rates](https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/get-the-best-heloc-rate/) and terms, too. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to [shop around for the best deal](https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/where-should-you-get-a-home-equity-loan/).\n\n- ### Methodology\n\nCaret Down Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine a mortgage lender\u2019s Bankrate Score, Bankrate rates lenders on a scale of one (1) to five (5) stars \u2014 with five (5) the highest rating \u2014 based on a variety of factors relating to the lender\u2019s products and services. To assign our ratings, we assessed each mortgage lender across three core areas:\n\n\n\n- Affordability: Annual percentage rate (APR) - 80%; introductory APR - 20%\n- Availability: Licensing - 50%; credit score - 20%; loan minimum - 10%; draw requirement - 10%; loan products - 10%\n- Borrower experience: Rate transparency - 35%; convenience - 35%; customer service - 20%; fixed-rate options - 10%\n\nLearn more about our [methodology](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/lender-review-methodology/).\n\n## Aven customer ratings and reviews\n\n![logo](https://www.brimg.net/system/img/inst/11841_hires_logo.png)\n\n3.2\n\nRating: 3.23 stars out of 5\n\n31 ratings\n\nStar ranking and total number reflects the lifetime customer reviews received while this lender has been an advertiser on Bankrate.

Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven's control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans. The Index may change several times a year or go for many months without change.\n\n- How does Aven determine the credit line size and interest rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven's bank-standard underwriting system is fully automated, and calculates offers based on an applicant's income, equity, credit, and debt obligations.\n\n- Does Aven offer a fixed rate? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nSome Aven cardholders may be able to create fixed payment, fixed rate Simple Loan plans.

There may be a one time fee (please see your account agreement) of the total amount being transferred that will be added to the balance.\n\n\n##### Payments\n\n- How are payments calculated for fixed installment plans? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven offers fixed payment plans that amortize over several years, details being in the account agreement. The payment is calculated so that the entire amount of the plan and the interest is paid off by the end of the selected term. For payment estimates, please visit [https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator](https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator)\n\n- How do you compute my minimum due every month? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nFor revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan's minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. For payment estimates, please visit [https://aven.com/paymentCalculator](https://aven.com/paymentCalculator).\n\n- Is there a prepayment penalty? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThere is no a prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment. Cardholders can also find more details about their Account Agreement, here [https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails](https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails)\n\nImportant Note: If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released. Aven is unable to waive or shorten this wait period.\n\n- How is interest calculated on the Aven account? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nInterest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type.\n\n\n- For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase.\n- For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed.\n- Any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation.\n\nIn addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal.\n\nIf an account has zero balance in any cycle, there will be no payment due for that cycle.\n\n- When is the monthly payment due? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nStatements are generated each month close to the monthly anniversary of when cardholders signed up for an Aven account. Payment due dates are highlighted in the statement as well as in the Aven Card app. Statements are available on the Aven app and online: [https://my.aven.com/statements](https://my.aven.com/statements)\n\n- How can I make a payment on my monthly statement? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nAven cardholders can pay their Aven bill using the Aven Card\u00a0 app. Please note that Aven does not accept checks or cash by mail.

We offer it solely to provide our customers with peace of mind when using their home equity.

What happens if only one of us loses their job while we are enrolled in Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIf either of the co-borrowers experiences involuntary unemployment, the account will be covered for the coverage listed above.\n\n- What happens if I don\u2019t pay the Debt Protection fee? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIf you don\u2019t pay your Debt Protection fees, the loan addendum will be considered lapsed and you will not be eligible to file a claim in the event of involuntary unemployment. Even if you are not able to pay your minimum monthly payment for Aven, as long as you pay your Debt Protection fees, you will be eligible to file a claim.\n\n- Can I appeal a claim decision for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThere is no option to appeal at this time. Securian's claim decision is final.\n\n- Do I need to be current on my account to file a Debt Protection claim? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nNo. You may file a claim even if you are delinquent. However, you will need to remit the Debt Protection fees owed in order to process the claim. The cardholder has active coverage if the protection has not lapsed. Please note, if a claim is successful, it will not bring your account current.\n\n- Are there any exclusions to filing a claim for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nDebt protection is not possible in the following cases:\n\n\n- A customer retires, quits, or resigns\n- A claim occurs in first 90 days of issuance\n- A claim occurs on or after 70th birthday\n\n- How do I file a claim for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nEmail us at support@aven.com or go to the Debt Protection tab located in the sidebar menu of your Aven mobile application.\n\nThere you will see a link to file a claim. You will be routed to Securian Financial - our claims administrator - to provide details related to your job loss event and submit documentation.\n\nOnce a decision has been made, Securian Financial will notify you and Aven and issue a payment to Aven under the contractual liability policy. Please note that the cancellation date would be effective as of the date of unemployment.\n\n- How are Debt Protection fees calculated? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nThe monthly rate charged is $0.92 per $1,000 of balances for single accounts and $1.75 per $1,000 of balances for joint accounts.\n\n\n\nFor example, if you have $30,000 of outstanding balances at your statement date, you would see a $27.60 charge as a single account holder and a $52.50 charge as a joint account holder in the following statement. Fees are always paid for balances in arrears.\n\n\n\nThis fee will show up on your monthly statement as a separate charge. As long as you are current on paying these fees, you will be able to file a claim in the event of involuntary job loss.\n\n- How much am I covered for with Debt Protection? Are there any limitations with Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nDebt Protection covers participating customers up to $50,000 in total payments and up to $1,000 in monthly payments for up to 6 months. Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence.\n\n\n\nAs an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining.\n\n\n\nPlease note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current.\n\n- Is Debt Protection considered an insurance product? How does Debt Protection work? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nNo, Debt Protection is not an insurance protection. Anyone who elects to join will sign an addendum to their loan agreement with Aven. In the event of involuntary job loss, Aven will cancel up to six months of a borrower\u2019s monthly payments per occurrence of job loss if the claim is approved.\n\n\n\nAven maintains a contractual liability policy and administrative services agreement with Securian Financial. In the event of a Debt Protection claim, Securian would approve it and reimburse funds to Aven Financial.\n\n- Who is eligible for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nIn order to qualify, you must:\n\n\n- Be under 70 years old\n- Actively work a minimum of 24 hours per week\n- Not be self-employed\n\n- What is Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg)\nFor a small monthly fee, you can protect yourself and your home for up to six months per occurrence of involuntary job loss. Aven makes no money from this offering - we offer it strictly for the benefit of any customers who are worried about potentially losing their home.\n\n\n\nPlease note, this product is only meant to help you manage your Aven card. Aven may still foreclose if the max monthly claim payment from debt protection is not sufficient to cover the minimum monthly payment due. Additionally, your first lien holder may still foreclose if you fall into default on mortgage payments.\n\n\nSHOW MORE\n\n##### Can't find what you need?\n\nSearch question, keywords, or

It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Percent Sign Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/rateIcon.bdf34906.svg)\n\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\n\nFor Cash Outs, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. One time 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.[4](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_4)\n\n![Calculator Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/paymentIcon.c7d44db7.svg)\n\nWhat is my monthly payment?\n\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. [See Payment Calculator](https://www.aven.com/PaymentCalculator).\n\n![Cash Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/cashIcon.12b80785.svg)\n\nCan I get cash too?\n\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Meter Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/creditScoreIcon.57152ad7.svg)\n\nDoes this affect my credit score?\n\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\n\n![Price Tag Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/feesIcon.54015658.svg)\n\nAre there any fees?\n\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don\u2019t make the minimum payment.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n##### More Questions...\n\nSearch\n\n# Become an Expert\n\n## Grow your knowledge with our educational articles written by our team of experts.\n\n[![Can you get cash from Aven card?](https://www.aven.com/img/can-you-get-cash-aven-card.b4532e86.webp)\\\n**Can you get cash from Aven card?** \\\n\\\nYes!

Now, it\u2019s offering a new product called **AvenCash**, a more traditional home equity line of credit (HELOC).\n\nAvenCash is ideal for homeowners looking for a HELOC that blends familiarity with innovation. It\u2019s also ideal for applicants with **credit scores of 720 and higher**. Despite the stated minimum credit score of 640, we\u2019ve observed that applicants with scores below 720 have a much lower chance of being approved and are better off [seeking alternatives to HELOCs](https://lendedu.com/blog/home-equity-loans-lines-of-credit-alternatives/) in general.\n\n![Aven logo](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Aven-logo-e1727891899813.png)\n\nBest customer reviews\n\n4.8 /5\n\n[View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/l5jxbby19yz1xjgv5e/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end)\n\nHELOC\n\n- Offers lowest rate guarantee\n- Optional debt protection program through Securian\n- Approval in as little as 15 minutes\n- Excellent customer reviews from more than 3,800 customers\n- 100% digital application process\n- Increases the credit line for select customers\n- Automated appraisals\n- High maximum loan-to-value ratio (LTV)\n- Three-day funding after signing\n- Fixed interest rates from start to finish\n- Check your rate with no credit impact\n\n- Short draw period\n- First-draw fee of 4.90%\n- Only available in 32 states\\*\n\n| | |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Rates (APR)** | 6.99% \u2013 15.49% |\n| **Loan amounts** | $5,000 \u2013 $400,000 |\n| **Repayment terms** | 5, 10, 15, or 30 years |\n| **Min. credit score** | 640 |\n| **Funding time** | As little as 3 days after signing |\n\n\\*Not currently available in Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia\n\nKeep reading to see how an Aven HELOC uses technology to make borrowing simpler and faster\u2014and to decide if it\u2019s right for you.\n\nTable of Contents Skip to Section\n\n- [How an Aven HELOC works](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#how)\n- [Draws and repayment](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#draw)\n- [Unique benefits](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#benefits)\n- [More about Aven HELOCs](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#eligible)\n\n## Aven HELOC at a glance\n\nAvenCash offers competitive rates, flexible repayment terms, and a generous maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Here\u2019s a closer look at the Aven HELOC highlights.\n\n| **Terms** | **Details** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rates (APR) | 6.99% \u2013 15.49% fixed |\n| HELOC amounts | $5,000 \u2013 $400,000 |\n| Minimum draw amount | Full HELOC amount |\n| Draw period | 5 years |\n| Term lengths | 5, 10, 15, or 30 years |\n| Origination (first-draw) fee | 4.90% |\n| Application fee | $0 |\n| Minimum credit score | 640 |\n| Max loan-to-value ratio | 89% |\n| Unique features | Automated appraisals; lowest rate guarantee; debt protection program; credit line increases for select customers |\n\n## How does an Aven HELOC work?\n\nAvenCash combines tech-infused applications and appraisals with borrower-friendly features that rival what you\u2019ll find with competing [home equity companies](https://lendedu.com/blog/list-of-home-equity-companies/). These features include:\n\n- **Instant prequalification**: Aven begins every application with an initial screening. You\u2019ll know within seconds if you\u2019re preapproved, and go from application all the way to closing in 15 minutes.\n- **Automatic income verification**: Aven uses a variety of sources to automatically verify your income, which makes the process quick and easy. Some customers may be asked to connect your bank account or manually upload proof of income.\n- **No property restrictions**: Primary residence? No problem. Investment property? Bring it on. New build? That\u2019s fine, too. Aven considers every property, even those held in a trust.\n- **Minimal insurance requirements**: Aven doesn\u2019t require proof of insurance unless your home is in a flood zone or your credit line is more than $100,000.\n- **Digital appraisals and notarization:** You can complete the entire HELOC process from a phone or computer. Aven uses automated valuation models (AVMs), which rely on recent sale information, current-year tax assessments, and other data to [determine your home value](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-is-home-value-determined-for-heloc/), and its online notaries help you close on your HELOC 100% online. No signing of paper docs is needed.\n- **Fast funding**: You can start using your HELOC three business days after signing.\n\nIn addition, **all AvenCash HELOCs come with fixed rates**. While some lenders let you convert variable rates to fixed rates, only a few offer fixed rates for your entire term. Fixed rates provide stability and predictability in your monthly payment\u2014it won\u2019t fluctuate unless you withdraw additional funds or pay down your outstanding balance.\n\n![](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/plugins/lendeducom-gutenberg-blocks/src/assets/img/readmore.svg)\n\nRead More\n\n[What is a home equity line of credit?](https://lendedu.com/blog/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit/)\n\n## How do you draw from and repay an Aven HELOC?\n\nAven lets you [pull from your HELOC](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-does-draw-period-work-on-heloc/) as often as you need over five years. However, it\u2019s important to note that Aven requires you to draw the full HELOC amount at origination.\n\nSo, while you can redraw from your line anytime during the five-year draw period, you\u2019ll need to repay some of the balance to free up funds before making additional withdrawals.\n\nOnce you enter [HELOC repayment](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-does-heloc-repayment-work/), Aven allows you to customize your repayment period anywhere from five to 30 years to pay off your credit line.\n\n## Do Aven HELOCs come with any unique borrower benefits?\n\nIn addition to the features and rates that make Aven\u2019s HELOC a solid competitor in the home equity marketplace, the company offers some unique benefits that we find valuable for HELOC borrowers. These include:\n\n- **Lowest rate guarantee:** If you qualify with other HELOC lenders and can get a lower rate elsewhere, let Aven know, and it will beat the offer or send you $100.\n- **Refinancing available:** Homeowners with a second lien (like an existing HELOC or [home equity loan](https://lendedu.com/blog/what-is-a-home-equity-loan/)) can refinance it into an Aven HELOC. There are no origination fees or transfer fees to refinance.\n- **Automatic credit line increases:** If you make on-time payments and/or your home equity increases, Aven will automatically invite you for a credit line increase.\n- **Debt protection through Securian:** Aven offers a unique program in which borrowers can pay a monthly fee ranging from $0.92 to $1.75 per $1,000 of HELOC balance\u2014up to $50,000. If you become involuntarily unemployed (meaning you are laid off or let go from your job), Securian will cover six months of minimum payments up to $1,000 per month.\n\n## Who\u2019s eligible for an Aven HELOC?\n\nQualifying for an Aven HELOC hinges primarily on your [credit score](https://lendedu.com/blog/credit-score-needed-home-equity-loans/), built-up equity, and location.\n\nAs with most lenders, Aven needs to see that you can handle additional debt and that your home\u2019s value will hold steady until that debt is repaid.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Aven accepts joint applications, which could be helpful if you apply with a spouse, for example, with a higher credit score.\n\nAven doesn\u2019t lend in every state, however. Here are Aven\u2019s eligibility criteria and residency requirements in greater detail:\n\n| **Requirements** | **Details** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Eligible properties | Primary residences and investment properties |\n| State of residence | Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming |\n| Maximum loan-to-value (LTV) | 89% |\n| Maximum debt-to-income | Not disclosed |\n| Minimum credit score | 640 |\n| Minimum income | Not disclosed |\n\n## What are the costs and fees of an Aven HELOC?\n\nYou won\u2019t pay many fees with Aven, but its HELOC isn\u2019t entirely fee-free. **While Aven doesn\u2019t charge application or appraisal fees, it does levy a 4.90% first-draw fee, which is essentially an origination fee**. Aven also assesses a $29 late fee on its home equity card, though it\u2019s unclear if this applies to AvenCash.\n\nHowever, fees are only one piece of the HELOC affordability puzzle. These fees work in tandem with your interest rate to create your annual percentage rate (APR). Your APR reflects the true premium you pay for your credit line, so locking in the lowest possible APR is imperative.\n\nTo better illustrate how APR can influence your borrowing cost, let\u2019s say that you withdraw $50,000 from your HELOC at an 11% APR. Here\u2019s how much your HELOC would cost over time:\n\n![Infographic showing how APR can influence borrowing cost.](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcb25g1LtEo-kbiI6k7EzoIkL0_SJOwQTyjQ-kVI25QaZfTk9d4u22Gf1JuvxwlmaJolZXGNFSJIJa7wEJ9g0pCa3zIeq2R2APXFvLhs7UQ9PAsE4_Pe8d6dvm-FtpKYgpVR9KetxA6NAe2ra9_FZ0-Nlo?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nWhat started as a $50,000 balance ballooned into a six-figure price tag because of your 11% APR. But what if you held out for a better rate and qualified for a 9% APR instead? How might that change your payments and overall borrowing cost?\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe5uFidA5GimocFg2duH_EjR8H1VydxvXSTen9tXS9JhKawHYYJPw59-qBmV5XTkoGCtBgesakhAPOz47jbNqEt2lyAiRl5f3bSKlyWK3NQ0_skxu9bMFNjVioskgX4FVXifVgLH8msS_iBSwgg4T9ohlo?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nIf we look just at your monthly payments, particularly your payments once your draw period ends, it\u2019s easy to miss how influential your APR really is.\n\nHowever, we can see your APR\u2019s cumulative impact when we zoom out. Not only are your monthly payments more affordable at the lower rate, but you\u2019ve also saved $11,531 over the life of your HELOC.\n\n## How does your home\u2019s value affect your terms?\n\nIn addition to your credit score, Aven\u2019s automated underwriting process also\u00a0[factors in your home equity](https://www.aven.com/support/article/360061758811#:~:text=an%20applicant%27s%20income%2C-,equity,-%2C%20credit%2C%20and%20debt)\u00a0and, by extension, your home\u2019s value. Generally speaking, **lower home values and lower equity translate to lower credit limits, higher rates, or both**.\n\nThis is where LTV comes into play. This ratio compares what you owe on your home to what it\u2019s worth. Aven accepts up to an 89% LTV, so your combined home-secured debt can\u2019t exceed 89% of your home\u2019s value.\n\nThat home-secured debt includes any existing financing, like your mortgage, as well as your new HELOC. Say, for instance, that you owe $150,000 on a $300,000 home. Here\u2019s how Aven might calculate [how much you can borrow with a HELOC](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-much-can-i-borrow-on-heloc/) in light of its LTV threshold:\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf8laOyBZE4hyFaQjraHA0UXi07mLGHaRsM_J8Iwi5FjB-bJ9qiyKU1SMadNcicL6s8UF5oV9gQfMWYhwhdCyRV0vWypKluLfrbPhgulFnmIIsItqw4H5jz-RXbxysOJCxuzcX7PHtKQPMQZdfm3estd1g?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nBut what if Aven determined your home value to be slightly higher? Take a look below to see how much more you could borrow if your home appraised at $325,000 instead:\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdkkXz_Rr33A4nn6_basjCc-E7EIuCDb_-K-KH48e3wkeyF18o-2lU3TICaBZcXS-hZ6rWZG8EMoQS0Vo68dCePXyy_jcxJmNYIr8zZrRiBCK_2GP_5F0v-5_sHNOqX09krx-rxDln9ev3p1Sfly6_7w3YC?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nIn our first example, $117,000 was the largest HELOC you could get without surpassing the 89% cap. With the increased property value in our second example, your potential HELOC limit went up by $22,250.\n\nBefore you rush to remodel your kitchen, we should mention that virtual appraisals don\u2019t always capture improvements like these. That\u2019s because these appraisals rely on tax data and recent selling prices of nearby homes, not necessarily a physical examination of your property.\n\nRather than investing in renovations you weren\u2019t otherwise planning, you may see better results\u2014both to your HELOC limit and your long-term financial position\u2014by reducing your mortgage balance instead.\n\n## Pros & cons of Aven HELOCs\n\nPros\n\n- High maximum LTV\n\nAven\u2019s 89% LTV threshold makes its HELOC more accessible to more homeowners. It also means you could open a larger HELOC than you\u2019d qualify for elsewhere.\n\n- Fixed rates\n\nWith Aven, your HELOC rate will never change, so you\u2019ll know what to expect month after month.\n\n- Few fees\n\nUnlike some of its competitors, Aven doesn\u2019t charge application, appraisal, or notary fees. You won\u2019t pay an annual fee, either.\n\n- Customizable repayment options\n\nAven offers four different repayment periods, and you can choose the term that best suits your finances.\n\n- Completely virtual application and appraisal\n\nYou\u2019ll forego the time and hassle of scheduling a traditional appraisal with Aven. You could apply and get approved in as little as 15 minutes.\n\n- Unique borrower benefits\n\nFrom its lowest rate guarantee to its debt protection program, Aven offers borrowers unique benefits you can\u2019t find with other lenders.\n\n\nCons\n\n- Virtual appraisals aren\u2019t always accurate\n\nWhile convenient, automated appraisals aren\u2019t as thorough as in-person valuations. Because it can\u2019t catch everything, Aven\u2019s system might undervalue your home.\n\n- Not available everywhere\n\nAven only lends in 32 states, rendering many homeowners ineligible for its HELOC.\n\n- Limited draw period\n\nAven\u2019s draw period is considerably shorter than what you might get with another lender, which is only five years.\n\n- Full amount is drawn at origination\n\nAven requires borrowers to draw their entire HELOC amount initially, meaning you must repay some of the balance within that five-year draw period to redraw funds as needed.\n\n- No introductory rates or rate discounts\n\nSome HELOC companies offer perks like a reduced rate for your first 12 months or when you sign up for autopay. Aven, however, isn\u2019t one of them.\n\n\n## Is Aven a reputable lender?\n\n**Aven\u2019s thousands of positive Trustpilot reviews and an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) certainly lend the company credibility**.\n\nWhile most of Aven\u2019s existing reviews center on its HELOC card, we can use those reviews to infer the service quality you\u2019ll experience with its traditional HELOC. Here\u2019s a closer look at how past customers rate the lender:\n\n| | | |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Source | Customer rating | Number of reviews |\n| Trustpilot | 4.9 stars | 3,811 |\n| Better Business Bureau | 1 star | 7 |\n\nCollected on August 30, 2024.\n\nDespite the one-star customer rating on the site, we consider Aven\u2019s A+ rating from the BBB a significant endorsement of its reliability. With a limited sample size of just seven reviews, we weigh those reviews less heavily than the 3,793 reviews on Trustpilot, where Aven boasts an impressive 4.9-star rating.\n\nThe combination of an A+ BBB rating and the overwhelmingly positive Trustpilot feedback is what led us to designate Aven\u2019s HELOC as the best for customer reviews.\n\nEfficiency and clear communication are common threads throughout Aven\u2019s Trustpilot reviews. Many borrowers applaud the company\u2019s quick application process and speak highly of its customer support team.\n\nOf course, no lender is perfect. Aven\u2019s lowest ratings come from customers frustrated by a lack of clear communication. One reviewer reported getting mixed messages regarding their approval, while another shared that their HELOC card was frozen unexpectedly.\n\n## Does Aven have a customer service team?\n\nWhether you\u2019re seeking general information or have a specific question, Aven\u2019s team is ready to help. The San Francisco-based company offers multiple ways to get in touch:\n\n- **Email**: Connect with the Aven team by emailing [\\[email\u00a0protected\\]](https://lendedu.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cebdbbbebea1bcba8eafb8aba0e0ada1a3).\n- **Contact form**: Send a message to Aven\u2019s representatives directly from the website.\n- **Phone**: Call Aven at [415-582-6613](tel:415-582-6613) to leave a voice message. Alternatively, you can [schedule a callback](https://aven.com/call) online.\n\nAven doesn\u2019t list its hours of operation, and it encourages homeowners to use email for faster communication. If you prefer to speak with a live human, consider scheduling a callback instead.\n\n## How to apply for an Aven HELOC\n\nAven\u2019s tech-powered HELOC application process is just as innovative as its product offerings. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. **Enter your phone number to start the application**. Alternatively, you can enter your Aven invite code if you have one.\n2. **Tell Aven how much you need to borrow**. You\u2019ll also tell Aven how you plan to use your credit line.\n3. **Provide your contact details and identifying information**. This includes your date of birth and the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you\u2019re applying with another person, you\u2019ll also enter their information.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdQq2Yj2vKOqDLmkbC6JpgpyyfL_WskxdA-bpUX6BFu3Gypl81WFEdW6KMFusEurKGSRp6wRsTiiWKDULDXHBhHcbK97e9ZPtIfTYJr5_beqx_DxSe0uiNwP1RvyE2Kd1FjozDb8d3fqpg88yYCDUyv4vFO?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\n1. **View your prequalified offers**. At this stage, you haven\u2019t consented to a hard credit pull. You\u2019re simply getting Aven\u2019s preliminary approval and choosing the potential HELOC terms that work best for you.\n2. **Verify your income**. Aven automatically verifies the majority of its customers\u2019 income when you apply. Some customers may be asked to either link your bank account with Plaid or send in documents like W-2s or 1099s for manual review.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeopdNOh-WyLQpZnRlNj2Z6Dzty5zTxtkvyPkQXTk-DbS8e8iGxhurP4nsMgKi5EuBbF9x97CNy07K5gJp23a0JY619tsxwxHwlTdXr1h4pJjzVD29gKtZwkeq-ocl75OWwCLpfKd2ZTyK7iRweZ1lyBkw?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\n1. **Submit your application**.Now, you\u2019ll give Aven permission to run your credit and present you with a final HELOC offer.\n2. **Schedule your notary session**. If approved, Aven will connect you with an online notary to review and sign your documents.\n\nAfter reading your HELOC agreement, prepare to hang tight through the mandatory [three-day waiting period](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/home-equity-loans-and-home-equity-lines-credit#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Three%2DDay,cancel%20the%20deal%20without%20penalty.). As soon as this window passes, Aven will fund your HELOC, and you\u2019ll have access to your new credit line.\n\n## Aven HELOC alternatives\n\nFor many homeowners, Aven may be the clear winner, and for good reason. Still, it\u2019s wise to consider your options before committing to a lender. Here are three of the [best HELOC lenders](https://lendedu.com/blog/home-equity-line-of-credit/) available:\n\n| **Company** | **Best for\u2026** | **Rating**(0-5) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Figure logo](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/figure_refi.png) 4.9 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/figure-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best overall | 4.9 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/figure-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\n| ![](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/FourLeaf_logo_EHL-NMLS_FCU-1.png) 4.7 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/bethpage-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best for large HELOCs | 4.7 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/bethpage-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\n| ![lendingtree logo](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lendingtree-logo.png) 4.5 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/lendingtree-heloc-heloc/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best for comparison shopping | 4.5 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/lendingtree-heloc-heloc/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\n\nWhile these companies share commonalities with Aven, each one offers distinct advantages that Aven doesn\u2019t:\n\n- [**Figure**](https://lendedu.com/blog/figure-home-equity-loan-review/) is available in more states. It also allows LTVs up to 95%.\n- [**FourLeaf**](https://lendedu.com/blog/bethpage-home-equity-review/) boasts a 10-year draw period and HELOCs up to $1 million.\n- [**LendingTree**](https://lendedu.com/blog/lendingtree-home-equity-loans-review/) shows you multiple prequalified offers in one place.\n\nThose prequalified offers are key to choosing the right lender. They tell you instantly which companies can give you the HELOC you\u2019re looking for and which ones can\u2019t.\n\nSince prequalifying doesn\u2019t hurt your credit, we recommend checking your rates with at least four lenders. Compare each offer, paying close attention to APRs, credit limits, and term lengths.\n\nIt may be tempting to accept the first HELOC offer you get. But by slowing down and carefully evaluating your options, you\u2019ll boost your odds of locking in not just any HELOC but a HELOC that\u2019s virtually tailor-made for you.\n\n## How we rated Aven\n\nWe designed LendEDU\u2019s editorial rating system to help readers find companies that offer the best HELOCs. Our system awards higher ratings to companies with affordable solutions, positive customer reviews, and online transparency of benefits and terms.\n\nWe compared Aven to several home equity lenders, using hundreds of data points from company websites, public disclosures, customer reviews, and direct communication with company representatives. We weighted, scored, and combined each factor to produce a final editorial rating. This rating is expressed on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest possible score. Our take is represented in our rating, recapped below.\n\n| | | |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Product | Best for | Our rating |\n| [Aven HELOC](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/l5jxbby19yz1xjgv5e/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end&lemeta=recap-table) | Best customer reviews | 4.8/5 |\n\n4.8AvenCash HELOC",

Aven combines the convenience of a credit card with the savings of a home equity line of credit (HELOC). It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back. Checking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.",

It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Percent Sign Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/rateIcon.bdf34906.svg)\n\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\n\nFor Cash Outs, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. One time 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.[4](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_4)\n\n![Calculator Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/paymentIcon.c7d44db7.svg)\n\nWhat is my monthly payment?\n\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. [See Payment Calculator](https://www.aven.com/PaymentCalculator).\n\n![Cash Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/cashIcon.12b80785.svg)\n\nCan I get cash too?\n\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Meter Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/creditScoreIcon.57152ad7.svg)\n\nDoes this affect my credit score?\n\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\n\n![Price Tag Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/feesIcon.54015658.svg)\n\nAre there any fees?\n\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don\u2019t make the minimum payment.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n##### More Questions...\n\nSearch\n\n# Become an Expert\n\n## Grow your knowledge with our educational articles written by our team of experts.\n\n[![Can you get cash from Aven card?](https://www.aven.com/img/can-you-get-cash-aven-card.b4532e86.webp)\\\n**Can you get cash from Aven card?** \\\n\\\nYes!

    "text": "Now that you understand what a HELOC Card is, let\u2019s dive into how it works. This article also explains where you can use your card and how it differs from the credit cards in your wallet. How to get a HELOC Card To use a traditional HELOC, you typically need to transfer funds to a checking account before making purchases or use special checks issued to you by the lender. This process can be complicated, time-consuming and frustrating. Some lenders will instead give you a HELOC Card to use at your convenience so you can access your funds immediately. However, there are several requirements to be eligible to apply, including: proving you have a steady income, being listed on your home\u2019s title, having a certain credit score and possessing a valid ID. If you meet the requirements, the application process typically looks something like this: Complete the online application, which asks questions about yourself and your home Verify your income by providing pay stubs or a company verification letter Meet with a notary to sign required documents Receive your card within a few business days Where can HELOC funds be used? Once your card arrives in the mail, you can start making purchases with it right away. You can use your card at any merchant that accepts major credit cards, like Visa and MasterCard. Experts recommend using a HELOC Card for purchases that help increase wealth over the long run. For example, many homeowners tend to use their funds on home improvements or remodeling, which can significantly increase the property\u2019s value. You can also use the card to transfer balances from personal loans or other credit cards. While there are no restrictions on what products or services you can purchase with a HELOC Card, financial advisors typically advise against using your card on frivolous items or experiences, such as vacations or a new car, which are unlikely to increase your wealth. These types of purchases could even make it harder to pay off your HELOC balance in the future. How to pay for charges made on a HELOC Card Every month, you will receive a statement with your charges, much like you do with a traditional credit card. The monthly bill for a HELOC Card from Aven, for example, consists of 1% of the principal balance plus finance and interest charges on the average daily balance during your last billing cycle. If you choose to pay only your minimum balance each month, it can take you a very long time to pay your balance back. You can choose to pay more than the minimum or to make payments more often than once a month if you'd like to pay down your debt sooner. If you can't pay your monthly bill on time, you will likely incur a late fee. How is a HELOC Card different from a credit card? While a HELOC Card is used in a similar way as a regular credit card, they are not the same. The main difference is that a HELOC Card uses your home\u2019s equity to secure the loan, while a credit card doesn\u2019t require any collateral. Consequently, HELOC Cards have much lower interest rates than credit cards. However, unlike with a credit card, the rate is usually variable, meaning it moves up and down based on a benchmark rate. Are you looking for a HELOC Card? Aven is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back. Aven is the world's first home equity-backed credit card and combines the low interest rates of a home equity line of credit with the flexibility of a credit card. Click here to learn more!",

While certainly convenient, the card is best suited for highly responsible borrowers, as it\u2019s easy to lose track of how much equity you\u2019re tapping (and how much debt your home is serving as collateral for). Aven also offers a fully online experience, which is fine for the tech-savvy. But some borrowers might miss the option of in-person assistance.\n\n## Aven home equity loan overview\n\nAven was founded in 2019 by former executives from Facebook and Square. Its first product, the Aven Home Card, launched in 2022. Since its inception, Aven has issued over $1.5 billion in credit lines via the card. The fast-growing fintech company also offers a financial advisory tool, Aven Advisor.\n\nIn July 2024, Aven announced it had received a new round of $142 million in investment funding.\n\n### Aven home equity products offered\n\nAven\u2019s product isn\u2019t a typical home equity line of credit (HELOC) or HE loan; it\u2019s a credit card. You\u2019ll get a line of credit based on your tappable home equity, like a HELOC, and receive unlimited 2 percent cash back on purchases, like a cash-back reward credit card.\n\nThe card is a Visa card and backed by Coastal Community Bank, an FDIC-insured institution. Along with individual purchases, you can use the Aven HELOC card to cash out your home equity in large amounts, with the funds going directly into your designated bank account. You have the option to repay the funds in fixed installments over five or 10 years, similar to a home equity loan (\u201cAven Simple Loan\u201d).\n\nAven also offers a HELOC refinance product, in which users can refinance their existing second -lien HELOC or home equity loan to an Aven HELOC. There are no origination or transfer fees associated with the refinance.\n\n## Pros and cons of Aven\n\n### Pros\n\n- Checkmark Icon\n\nNo annual, origination, appraisal, notary or pre-payment fees.\n\n- Checkmark Icon\n\nYou can be approved in as fast as 15 minutes.\n\n- Checkmark Icon\n\nUnique product that provides a convenient way to tap equity for both big draws and small purchases.\n\n\n### Cons\n\n- Aven charges a 2.5 percent fee on balance transfers and cash-outs.\n\n- Not available in all states. Line of credit size is limited in 15 states.\n\n- Convenience of the card could encourage irresponsible use of home equity.\n\n\n## How Bankrate scored Aven\n\n### Affordability: 5/5\n\n- **APR:** Aven now provides a lowest rate guarantee. If you're able to get a lower HELOC rate with another lender, it will beat the offer or send you $100. Its APRs for primary residences run between 7.74% and 15.24% (depending on your credit) \u2014 low compared to most credit cards. Also, Aven\u2019s maximum APR won\u2019t exceed 18 percent during the life of your account.\n- **Fees:**\u00a0There are no annual, sign-up, or prepayment fees, but you\u2019ll pay a 2.5% fee on cash outs and balance transfers. You will also be on the hook for a $29 late fee if you miss the minimum payment.\n\nThe absence of fees, competitive APRs and the lowest rate guarantee all help Aven score a 5 out of 5 affordability rating.\n\n### Availability:\u00a0 4.9/5\n\n- **Credit score**: You will need a FICO score and VantageScore of at least 640, which is typical of home equity lenders.\n- **Loan products**: Aven\u2019s credit card allows you to tap into your home equity while offering cash rewards. All purchases you make with the Aven card will earn you unlimited 2 percent cash back.\n- **Where to find it:**\u00a0Aven is available in most U.S. states except Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. The company has a goal of reaching all 50 states by 2025.\n\nAven scores 4.9 out of 5 for availability due to its unique home equity credit card, ability to earn 2 percent cash back and its reach across the majority of states in the U.S.\n\n### Borrower experience: 4.0/5\n\n- **Rate transparency:** While you won\u2019t see your APR until you receive your offer, Aven only performs a \u201csoft pull\u201d on your credit report, which doesn\u2019t affect your credit score. (If you do accept the offer, a hard inquiry follows, which can temporarily impact your score.)\n- **Convenience:** Borrowers can use their Aven card to purchase anything wherever Visa cards are accepted. However, it can\u2019t be used for cash withdrawals from an ATM or bank.\n- **Customer service:** The application process can be completed completely online and if you need support, Aven is reachable by phone, email, online form, online chat and text message.\n\nBorrowers can use their card for purchases everywhere Visa is accepted and they offer multiple support options, giving Aven a 4 out of 5 for borrower experience.\n\n## Aven\u2019s reputation\n\nWhile it\u2019s a relative newcomer in the home equity lending space, Aven gets a 4.9 out of 5 review on Trustpilot.\n\n### What consumers say about Aven\n\nDespite a few digs about \u201cdelayed response times,\u201d customer reviews are largely glowing for Aven on Bankrate, especially for the \u201cfast,\u201d \u201csimple\u201d application process: \u201cSo easy to do, it's a no brainer for homeowners.\u201d\n\n## How to qualify for a HELOC card with Aven\n\nAven lets you take out as much as 89 percent of your home\u2019s equity. You will also need to have a FICO and a Vantage credit score of at least 640; customers with higher scores will get better rates.\n\nYou can get the card with equity tied to either a primary residence, second home or investment property, but the designated property can only have one mortgage attached to it at the time you apply.\n\nIf you obtain a credit line higher than $100,000, you\u2019ll also need to add Aven and Coastal Community Bank as beneficiaries on your homeowners insurance policy.\n\n## How to apply with Aven\n\nYou can apply for an Aven HELOC card on Aven\u2019s website, email them at [support@aven.com](mailto:support@aven.com) or call 415-582-6613. The application process typically takes just 15 minutes, according to the website. Checking just to see if you qualify for the card will not affect your credit score.\n\nLightbulb Icon\n\nBankrate insight\n\nYou can tap into your home equity \u2014 the difference between your home's worth and what you owe on your mortgage \u2014 with a home equity loan or a HELOC. With those funds, you can tackle a variety of expenses, like debt consolidation or home renovations.\n\nHowever, before you dive in, it's important to figure out your loan-to-value ratio (LTV). Lenders use your LTV to determine how much of your equity stake you can actually borrow. (It\u2019s typically 80 percent, although some lenders allow you to access as much as 90 percent.) The amount of equity they\u2019ll let you tap is one consideration when choosing a lender. Be it a retail bank, online lender or credit union, it may offer different [home equity loan rates](https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/get-the-best-heloc-rate/) and terms, too. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to [shop around for the best deal](https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/where-should-you-get-a-home-equity-loan/).\n\n- ### Methodology\n\nCaret Down Icon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo determine a mortgage lender\u2019s Bankrate Score, Bankrate rates lenders on a scale of one (1) to five (5) stars \u2014 with five (5) the highest rating \u2014 based on a variety of factors relating to the lender\u2019s products and services. To assign our ratings, we assessed each mortgage lender across three core areas:\n\n\n\n- Affordability: Annual percentage rate (APR) - 80%; introductory APR - 20%\n- Availability: Licensing - 50%; credit score - 20%; loan minimum - 10%; draw requirement - 10%; loan products - 10%\n- Borrower experience: Rate transparency - 35%; convenience - 35%; customer service - 20%; fixed-rate options - 10%\n\nLearn more about our [methodology](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/lender-review-methodology/).\n\n## Aven customer ratings and reviews\n\n![logo](https://www.brimg.net/system/img/inst/11841_hires_logo.png)\n\n3.2\n\nRating: 3.23 stars out of 5\n\n31 ratings\n\nStar ranking and total number reflects the lifetime customer reviews received while this lender has been an advertiser on Bankrate.

    "text": "Now that you understand what a HELOC Card is, let\u2019s dive into how it works. This article also explains where you can use your card and how it differs from the credit cards in your wallet. How to get a HELOC Card To use a traditional HELOC, you typically need to transfer funds to a checking account before making purchases or use special checks issued to you by the lender. This process can be complicated, time-consuming and frustrating. Some lenders will instead give you a HELOC Card to use at your convenience so you can access your funds immediately. However, there are several requirements to be eligible to apply, including: proving you have a steady income, being listed on your home\u2019s title, having a certain credit score and possessing a valid ID. If you meet the requirements, the application process typically looks something like this: Complete the online application, which asks questions about yourself and your home Verify your income by providing pay stubs or a company verification letter Meet with a notary to sign required documents Receive your card within a few business days Where can HELOC funds be used? Once your card arrives in the mail, you can start making purchases with it right away. You can use your card at any merchant that accepts major credit cards, like Visa and MasterCard. Experts recommend using a HELOC Card for purchases that help increase wealth over the long run. For example, many homeowners tend to use their funds on home improvements or remodeling, which can significantly increase the property\u2019s value. You can also use the card to transfer balances from personal loans or other credit cards. While there are no restrictions on what products or services you can purchase with a HELOC Card, financial advisors typically advise against using your card on frivolous items or experiences, such as vacations or a new car, which are unlikely to increase your wealth. These types of purchases could even make it harder to pay off your HELOC balance in the future. How to pay for charges made on a HELOC Card Every month, you will receive a statement with your charges, much like you do with a traditional credit card. The monthly bill for a HELOC Card from Aven, for example, consists of 1% of the principal balance plus finance and interest charges on the average daily balance during your last billing cycle. If you choose to pay only your minimum balance each month, it can take you a very long time to pay your balance back. You can choose to pay more than the minimum or to make payments more often than once a month if you'd like to pay down your debt sooner. If you can't pay your monthly bill on time, you will likely incur a late fee. How is a HELOC Card different from a credit card? While a HELOC Card is used in a similar way as a regular credit card, they are not the same. The main difference is that a HELOC Card uses your home\u2019s equity to secure the loan, while a credit card doesn\u2019t require any collateral. Consequently, HELOC Cards have much lower interest rates than credit cards. However, unlike with a credit card, the rate is usually variable, meaning it moves up and down based on a benchmark rate. Are you looking for a HELOC Card? Aven is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back. Aven is the world's first home equity-backed credit card and combines the low interest rates of a home equity line of credit with the flexibility of a credit card. Click here to learn more!",

    "text": "[Skip to content](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#primary)\n\nAven has already shaken up the home lending industry with its groundbreaking equity-backed credit card. Now, it\u2019s offering a new product called **AvenCash**, a more traditional home equity line of credit (HELOC).\n\nAvenCash is ideal for homeowners looking for a HELOC that blends familiarity with innovation. It\u2019s also ideal for applicants with **credit scores of 720 and higher**. Despite the stated minimum credit score of 640, we\u2019ve observed that applicants with scores below 720 have a much lower chance of being approved and are better off [seeking alternatives to HELOCs](https://lendedu.com/blog/home-equity-loans-lines-of-credit-alternatives/) in general.\n\n![Aven logo](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Aven-logo-e1727891899813.png)\n\nBest customer reviews\n\n4.8 /5\n\n[View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/l5jxbby19yz1xjgv5e/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end)\n\nHELOC\n\n- Offers lowest rate guarantee\n- Optional debt protection program through Securian\n- Approval in as little as 15 minutes\n- Excellent customer reviews from more than 3,800 customers\n- 100% digital application process\n- Increases the credit line for select customers\n- Automated appraisals\n- High maximum loan-to-value ratio (LTV)\n- Three-day funding after signing\n- Fixed interest rates from start to finish\n- Check your rate with no credit impact\n\n- Short draw period\n- First-draw fee of 4.90%\n- Only available in 32 states\\*\n\n| | |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Rates (APR)** | 6.99% \u2013 15.49% |\n| **Loan amounts** | $5,000 \u2013 $400,000 |\n| **Repayment terms** | 5, 10, 15, or 30 years |\n| **Min. credit score** | 640 |\n| **Funding time** | As little as 3 days after signing |\n\n\\*Not currently available in Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia\n\nKeep reading to see how an Aven HELOC uses technology to make borrowing simpler and faster\u2014and to decide if it\u2019s right for you.\n\nTable of Contents Skip to Section\n\n- [How an Aven HELOC works](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#how)\n- [Draws and repayment](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#draw)\n- [Unique benefits](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#benefits)\n- [More about Aven HELOCs](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#eligible)\n\n## Aven HELOC at a glance\n\nAvenCash offers competitive rates, flexible repayment terms, and a generous maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Here\u2019s a closer look at the Aven HELOC highlights.\n\n| **Terms** | **Details** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rates (APR) | 6.99% \u2013 15.49% fixed |\n| HELOC amounts | $5,000 \u2013 $400,000 |\n| Minimum draw amount | Full HELOC amount |\n| Draw period | 5 years |\n| Term lengths | 5, 10, 15, or 30 years |\n| Origination (first-draw) fee | 4.90% |\n| Application fee | $0 |\n| Minimum credit score | 640 |\n| Max loan-to-value ratio | 89% |\n| Unique features | Automated appraisals; lowest rate guarantee; debt protection program; credit line increases for select customers |\n\n## How does an Aven HELOC work?\n\nAvenCash combines tech-infused applications and appraisals with borrower-friendly features that rival what you\u2019ll find with competing [home equity companies](https://lendedu.com/blog/list-of-home-equity-companies/). These features include:\n\n- **Instant prequalification**: Aven begins every application with an initial screening. You\u2019ll know within seconds if you\u2019re preapproved, and go from application all the way to closing in 15 minutes.\n- **Automatic income verification**: Aven uses a variety of sources to automatically verify your income, which makes the process quick and easy. Some customers may be asked to connect your bank account or manually upload proof of income.\n- **No property restrictions**: Primary residence? No problem. Investment property? Bring it on. New build? That\u2019s fine, too. Aven considers every property, even those held in a trust.\n- **Minimal insurance requirements**: Aven doesn\u2019t require proof of insurance unless your home is in a flood zone or your credit line is more than $100,000.\n- **Digital appraisals and notarization:** You can complete the entire HELOC process from a phone or computer. Aven uses automated valuation models (AVMs), which rely on recent sale information, current-year tax assessments, and other data to [determine your home value](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-is-home-value-determined-for-heloc/), and its online notaries help you close on your HELOC 100% online. No signing of paper docs is needed.\n- **Fast funding**: You can start using your HELOC three business days after signing.\n\nIn addition, **all AvenCash HELOCs come with fixed rates**. While some lenders let you convert variable rates to fixed rates, only a few offer fixed rates for your entire term. Fixed rates provide stability and predictability in your monthly payment\u2014it won\u2019t fluctuate unless you withdraw additional funds or pay down your outstanding balance.\n\n![](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/plugins/lendeducom-gutenberg-blocks/src/assets/img/readmore.svg)\n\nRead More\n\n[What is a home equity line of credit?](https://lendedu.com/blog/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit/)\n\n## How do you draw from and repay an Aven HELOC?\n\nAven lets you [pull from your HELOC](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-does-draw-period-work-on-heloc/) as often as you need over five years. However, it\u2019s important to note that Aven requires you to draw the full HELOC amount at origination.\n\nSo, while you can redraw from your line anytime during the five-year draw period, you\u2019ll need to repay some of the balance to free up funds before making additional withdrawals.\n\nOnce you enter [HELOC repayment](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-does-heloc-repayment-work/), Aven allows you to customize your repayment period anywhere from five to 30 years to pay off your credit line.\n\n## Do Aven HELOCs come with any unique borrower benefits?\n\nIn addition to the features and rates that make Aven\u2019s HELOC a solid competitor in the home equity marketplace, the company offers some unique benefits that we find valuable for HELOC borrowers. These include:\n\n- **Lowest rate guarantee:** If you qualify with other HELOC lenders and can get a lower rate elsewhere, let Aven know, and it will beat the offer or send you $100.\n- **Refinancing available:** Homeowners with a second lien (like an existing HELOC or [home equity loan](https://lendedu.com/blog/what-is-a-home-equity-loan/)) can refinance it into an Aven HELOC. There are no origination fees or transfer fees to refinance.\n- **Automatic credit line increases:** If you make on-time payments and/or your home equity increases, Aven will automatically invite you for a credit line increase.\n- **Debt protection through Securian:** Aven offers a unique program in which borrowers can pay a monthly fee ranging from $0.92 to $1.75 per $1,000 of HELOC balance\u2014up to $50,000. If you become involuntarily unemployed (meaning you are laid off or let go from your job), Securian will cover six months of minimum payments up to $1,000 per month.\n\n## Who\u2019s eligible for an Aven HELOC?\n\nQualifying for an Aven HELOC hinges primarily on your [credit score](https://lendedu.com/blog/credit-score-needed-home-equity-loans/), built-up equity, and location.\n\nAs with most lenders, Aven needs to see that you can handle additional debt and that your home\u2019s value will hold steady until that debt is repaid.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Aven accepts joint applications, which could be helpful if you apply with a spouse, for example, with a higher credit score.\n\nAven doesn\u2019t lend in every state, however. Here are Aven\u2019s eligibility criteria and residency requirements in greater detail:\n\n| **Requirements** | **Details** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Eligible properties | Primary residences and investment properties |\n| State of residence | Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming |\n| Maximum loan-to-value (LTV) | 89% |\n| Maximum debt-to-income | Not disclosed |\n| Minimum credit score | 640 |\n| Minimum income | Not disclosed |\n\n## What are the costs and fees of an Aven HELOC?\n\nYou won\u2019t pay many fees with Aven, but its HELOC isn\u2019t entirely fee-free. **While Aven doesn\u2019t charge application or appraisal fees, it does levy a 4.90% first-draw fee, which is essentially an origination fee**. Aven also assesses a $29 late fee on its home equity card, though it\u2019s unclear if this applies to AvenCash.\n\nHowever, fees are only one piece of the HELOC affordability puzzle. These fees work in tandem with your interest rate to create your annual percentage rate (APR). Your APR reflects the true premium you pay for your credit line, so locking in the lowest possible APR is imperative.\n\nTo better illustrate how APR can influence your borrowing cost, let\u2019s say that you withdraw $50,000 from your HELOC at an 11% APR. Here\u2019s how much your HELOC would cost over time:\n\n![Infographic showing how APR can influence borrowing cost.](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcb25g1LtEo-kbiI6k7EzoIkL0_SJOwQTyjQ-kVI25QaZfTk9d4u22Gf1JuvxwlmaJolZXGNFSJIJa7wEJ9g0pCa3zIeq2R2APXFvLhs7UQ9PAsE4_Pe8d6dvm-FtpKYgpVR9KetxA6NAe2ra9_FZ0-Nlo?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nWhat started as a $50,000 balance ballooned into a six-figure price tag because of your 11% APR. But what if you held out for a better rate and qualified for a 9% APR instead? How might that change your payments and overall borrowing cost?\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe5uFidA5GimocFg2duH_EjR8H1VydxvXSTen9tXS9JhKawHYYJPw59-qBmV5XTkoGCtBgesakhAPOz47jbNqEt2lyAiRl5f3bSKlyWK3NQ0_skxu9bMFNjVioskgX4FVXifVgLH8msS_iBSwgg4T9ohlo?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nIf we look just at your monthly payments, particularly your payments once your draw period ends, it\u2019s easy to miss how influential your APR really is.\n\nHowever, we can see your APR\u2019s cumulative impact when we zoom out. Not only are your monthly payments more affordable at the lower rate, but you\u2019ve also saved $11,531 over the life of your HELOC.\n\n## How does your home\u2019s value affect your terms?\n\nIn addition to your credit score, Aven\u2019s automated underwriting process also\u00a0[factors in your home equity](https://www.aven.com/support/article/360061758811#:~:text=an%20applicant%27s%20income%2C-,equity,-%2C%20credit%2C%20and%20debt)\u00a0and, by extension, your home\u2019s value. Generally speaking, **lower home values and lower equity translate to lower credit limits, higher rates, or both**.\n\nThis is where LTV comes into play. This ratio compares what you owe on your home to what it\u2019s worth. Aven accepts up to an 89% LTV, so your combined home-secured debt can\u2019t exceed 89% of your home\u2019s value.\n\nThat home-secured debt includes any existing financing, like your mortgage, as well as your new HELOC. Say, for instance, that you owe $150,000 on a $300,000 home. Here\u2019s how Aven might calculate [how much you can borrow with a HELOC](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-much-can-i-borrow-on-heloc/) in light of its LTV threshold:\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf8laOyBZE4hyFaQjraHA0UXi07mLGHaRsM_J8Iwi5FjB-bJ9qiyKU1SMadNcicL6s8UF5oV9gQfMWYhwhdCyRV0vWypKluLfrbPhgulFnmIIsItqw4H5jz-RXbxysOJCxuzcX7PHtKQPMQZdfm3estd1g?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nBut what if Aven determined your home value to be slightly higher? Take a look below to see how much more you could borrow if your home appraised at $325,000 instead:\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdkkXz_Rr33A4nn6_basjCc-E7EIuCDb_-K-KH48e3wkeyF18o-2lU3TICaBZcXS-hZ6rWZG8EMoQS0Vo68dCePXyy_jcxJmNYIr8zZrRiBCK_2GP_5F0v-5_sHNOqX09krx-rxDln9ev3p1Sfly6_7w3YC?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nIn our first example, $117,000 was the largest HELOC you could get without surpassing the 89% cap. With the increased property value in our second example, your potential HELOC limit went up by $22,250.\n\nBefore you rush to remodel your kitchen, we should mention that virtual appraisals don\u2019t always capture improvements like these. That\u2019s because these appraisals rely on tax data and recent selling prices of nearby homes, not necessarily a physical examination of your property.\n\nRather than investing in renovations you weren\u2019t otherwise planning, you may see better results\u2014both to your HELOC limit and your long-term financial position\u2014by reducing your mortgage balance instead.\n\n## Pros & cons of Aven HELOCs\n\nPros\n\n- High maximum LTV\n\nAven\u2019s 89% LTV threshold makes its HELOC more accessible to more homeowners. It also means you could open a larger HELOC than you\u2019d qualify for elsewhere.\n\n- Fixed rates\n\nWith Aven, your HELOC rate will never change, so you\u2019ll know what to expect month after month.\n\n- Few fees\n\nUnlike some of its competitors, Aven doesn\u2019t charge application, appraisal, or notary fees. You won\u2019t pay an annual fee, either.\n\n- Customizable repayment options\n\nAven offers four different repayment periods, and you can choose the term that best suits your finances.\n\n- Completely virtual application and appraisal\n\nYou\u2019ll forego the time and hassle of scheduling a traditional appraisal with Aven. You could apply and get approved in as little as 15 minutes.\n\n- Unique borrower benefits\n\nFrom its lowest rate guarantee to its debt protection program, Aven offers borrowers unique benefits you can\u2019t find with other lenders.\n\n\nCons\n\n- Virtual appraisals aren\u2019t always accurate\n\nWhile convenient, automated appraisals aren\u2019t as thorough as in-person valuations. Because it can\u2019t catch everything, Aven\u2019s system might undervalue your home.\n\n- Not available everywhere\n\nAven only lends in 32 states, rendering many homeowners ineligible for its HELOC.\n\n- Limited draw period\n\nAven\u2019s draw period is considerably shorter than what you might get with another lender, which is only five years.\n\n- Full amount is drawn at origination\n\nAven requires borrowers to draw their entire HELOC amount initially, meaning you must repay some of the balance within that five-year draw period to redraw funds as needed.\n\n- No introductory rates or rate discounts\n\nSome HELOC companies offer perks like a reduced rate for your first 12 months or when you sign up for autopay. Aven, however, isn\u2019t one of them.\n\n\n## Is Aven a reputable lender?\n\n**Aven\u2019s thousands of positive Trustpilot reviews and an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) certainly lend the company credibility**.\n\nWhile most of Aven\u2019s existing reviews center on its HELOC card, we can use those reviews to infer the service quality you\u2019ll experience with its traditional HELOC. Here\u2019s a closer look at how past customers rate the lender:\n\n| | | |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Source | Customer rating | Number of reviews |\n| Trustpilot | 4.9 stars | 3,811 |\n| Better Business Bureau | 1 star | 7 |\n\nCollected on August 30, 2024.\n\nDespite the one-star customer rating on the site, we consider Aven\u2019s A+ rating from the BBB a significant endorsement of its reliability. With a limited sample size of just seven reviews, we weigh those reviews less heavily than the 3,793 reviews on Trustpilot, where Aven boasts an impressive 4.9-star rating.\n\nThe combination of an A+ BBB rating and the overwhelmingly positive Trustpilot feedback is what led us to designate Aven\u2019s HELOC as the best for customer reviews.\n\nEfficiency and clear communication are common threads throughout Aven\u2019s Trustpilot reviews. Many borrowers applaud the company\u2019s quick application process and speak highly of its customer support team.\n\nOf course, no lender is perfect. Aven\u2019s lowest ratings come from customers frustrated by a lack of clear communication. One reviewer reported getting mixed messages regarding their approval, while another shared that their HELOC card was frozen unexpectedly.\n\n## Does Aven have a customer service team?\n\nWhether you\u2019re seeking general information or have a specific question, Aven\u2019s team is ready to help. The San Francisco-based company offers multiple ways to get in touch:\n\n- **Email**: Connect with the Aven team by emailing [\\[email\u00a0protected\\]](https://lendedu.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cebdbbbebea1bcba8eafb8aba0e0ada1a3).\n- **Contact form**: Send a message to Aven\u2019s representatives directly from the website.\n- **Phone**: Call Aven at [415-582-6613](tel:415-582-6613) to leave a voice message. Alternatively, you can [schedule a callback](https://aven.com/call) online.\n\nAven doesn\u2019t list its hours of operation, and it encourages homeowners to use email for faster communication. If you prefer to speak with a live human, consider scheduling a callback instead.\n\n## How to apply for an Aven HELOC\n\nAven\u2019s tech-powered HELOC application process is just as innovative as its product offerings. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. **Enter your phone number to start the application**. Alternatively, you can enter your Aven invite code if you have one.\n2. **Tell Aven how much you need to borrow**. You\u2019ll also tell Aven how you plan to use your credit line.\n3. **Provide your contact details and identifying information**. This includes your date of birth and the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you\u2019re applying with another person, you\u2019ll also enter their information.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdQq2Yj2vKOqDLmkbC6JpgpyyfL_WskxdA-bpUX6BFu3Gypl81WFEdW6KMFusEurKGSRp6wRsTiiWKDULDXHBhHcbK97e9ZPtIfTYJr5_beqx_DxSe0uiNwP1RvyE2Kd1FjozDb8d3fqpg88yYCDUyv4vFO?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\n1. **View your prequalified offers**. At this stage, you haven\u2019t consented to a hard credit pull. You\u2019re simply getting Aven\u2019s preliminary approval and choosing the potential HELOC terms that work best for you.\n2. **Verify your income**. Aven automatically verifies the majority of its customers\u2019 income when you apply. Some customers may be asked to either link your bank account with Plaid or send in documents like W-2s or 1099s for manual review.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeopdNOh-WyLQpZnRlNj2Z6Dzty5zTxtkvyPkQXTk-DbS8e8iGxhurP4nsMgKi5EuBbF9x97CNy07K5gJp23a0JY619tsxwxHwlTdXr1h4pJjzVD29gKtZwkeq-ocl75OWwCLpfKd2ZTyK7iRweZ1lyBkw?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\n1. **Submit your application**.Now, you\u2019ll give Aven permission to run your credit and present you with a final HELOC offer.\n2. **Schedule your notary session**. If approved, Aven will connect you with an online notary to review and sign your documents.\n\nAfter reading your HELOC agreement, prepare to hang tight through the mandatory [three-day waiting period](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/home-equity-loans-and-home-equity-lines-credit#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Three%2DDay,cancel%20the%20deal%20without%20penalty.). As soon as this window passes, Aven will fund your HELOC, and you\u2019ll have access to your new credit line.\n\n## Aven HELOC alternatives\n\nFor many homeowners, Aven may be the clear winner, and for good reason. Still, it\u2019s wise to consider your options before committing to a lender. Here are three of the [best HELOC lenders](https://lendedu.com/blog/home-equity-line-of-credit/) available:\n\n| **Company** | **Best for\u2026** | **Rating**(0-5) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Figure logo](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/figure_refi.png) 4.9 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/figure-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best overall | 4.9 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/figure-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\n| ![](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/FourLeaf_logo_EHL-NMLS_FCU-1.png) 4.7 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/bethpage-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best for large HELOCs | 4.7 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/bethpage-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\n| ![lendingtree logo](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lendingtree-logo.png) 4.5 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/lendingtree-heloc-heloc/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best for comparison shopping | 4.5 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/lendingtree-heloc-heloc/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\n\nWhile these companies share commonalities with Aven, each one offers distinct advantages that Aven doesn\u2019t:\n\n- [**Figure**](https://lendedu.com/blog/figure-home-equity-loan-review/) is available in more states. It also allows LTVs up to 95%.\n- [**FourLeaf**](https://lendedu.com/blog/bethpage-home-equity-review/) boasts a 10-year draw period and HELOCs up to $1 million.\n- [**LendingTree**](https://lendedu.com/blog/lendingtree-home-equity-loans-review/) shows you multiple prequalified offers in one place.\n\nThose prequalified offers are key to choosing the right lender. They tell you instantly which companies can give you the HELOC you\u2019re looking for and which ones can\u2019t.\n\nSince prequalifying doesn\u2019t hurt your credit, we recommend checking your rates with at least four lenders. Compare each offer, paying close attention to APRs, credit limits, and term lengths.\n\nIt may be tempting to accept the first HELOC offer you get. But by slowing down and carefully evaluating your options, you\u2019ll boost your odds of locking in not just any HELOC but a HELOC that\u2019s virtually tailor-made for you.\n\n## How we rated Aven\n\nWe designed LendEDU\u2019s editorial rating system to help readers find companies that offer the best HELOCs. Our system awards higher ratings to companies with affordable solutions, positive customer reviews, and online transparency of benefits and terms.\n\nWe compared Aven to several home equity lenders, using hundreds of data points from company websites, public disclosures, customer reviews, and direct communication with company representatives. We weighted, scored, and combined each factor to produce a final editorial rating. This rating is expressed on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest possible score.

While certainly convenient, the card is best suited for highly responsible borrowers, as it\u2019s easy to lose track of how much equity you\u2019re tapping (and how much debt your home is serving as collateral for). Aven also offers a fully online experience, which is fine for the tech-savvy. But some borrowers might miss the option of in-person assistance.\n\n## Aven home equity loan overview\n\nAven was founded in 2019 by former executives from Facebook and Square. Its first product, the Aven Home Card, launched in 2022. Since its inception, Aven has issued over $1.5 billion in credit lines via the card. The fast-growing fintech company also offers a financial advisory tool, Aven Advisor.\n\nIn July 2024, Aven announced it had received a new round of $142 million in investment funding.\n\n### Aven home equity products offered\n\nAven\u2019s product isn\u2019t a typical home equity line of credit (HELOC) or HE loan; it\u2019s a credit card. You\u2019ll get a line of credit based on your tappable home equity, like a HELOC, and receive unlimited 2 percent cash back on purchases, like a cash-back reward credit card.\n\nThe card is a Visa card and backed by Coastal Community Bank, an FDIC-insured institution. Along with individual purchases, you can use the Aven HELOC card to cash out your home equity in large amounts, with the funds going directly into your designated bank account. You have the option to repay the funds in fixed installments over five or 10 years, similar to a home equity loan (\u201cAven Simple Loan\u201d).\n\nAven also offers a HELOC refinance product, in which users can refinance their existing second -lien HELOC or home equity loan to an Aven HELOC. There are no origination or transfer fees associated with the refinance.\n\n## Pros and cons of Aven\n\n### Pros\n\n- Checkmark Icon\n\nNo annual, origination, appraisal, notary or pre-payment fees.\n\n- Checkmark Icon\n\nYou can be approved in as fast as 15 minutes.\n\n- Checkmark Icon\n\nUnique product that provides a convenient way to tap equity for both big draws and small purchases.\n\n\n### Cons\n\n- Aven charges a 2.5 percent fee on balance transfers and cash-outs.\n\n- Not available in all states. Line of credit size is limited in 15 states.\n\n- Convenience of the card could encourage irresponsible use of home equity.\n\n\n## How Bankrate scored Aven\n\n### Affordability: 5/5\n\n- **APR:** Aven now provides a lowest rate guarantee. If you're able to get a lower HELOC rate with another lender, it will beat the offer or send you $100. Its APRs for primary residences run between 7.74% and 15.24% (depending on your credit) \u2014 low compared to most credit cards. Also, Aven\u2019s maximum APR won\u2019t exceed 18 percent during the life of your account.\n- **Fees:**\u00a0There are no annual, sign-up, or prepayment fees, but you\u2019ll pay a 2.5% fee on cash outs and balance transfers. You will also be on the hook for a $29 late fee if you miss the minimum payment.\n\nThe absence of fees, competitive APRs and the lowest rate guarantee all help Aven score a 5 out of 5 affordability rating.\n\n### Availability:\u00a0 4.9/5\n\n- **Credit score**: You will need a FICO score and VantageScore of at least 640, which is typical of home equity lenders.\n- **Loan products**: Aven\u2019s credit card allows you to tap into your home equity while offering cash rewards. All purchases you make with the Aven card will earn you unlimited 2 percent cash back.\n- **Where to find it:**\u00a0Aven is available in most U.S. states except Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. The company has a goal of reaching all 50 states by 2025.\n\nAven scores 4.9 out of 5 for availability due to its unique home equity credit card, ability to earn 2 percent cash back and its reach across the majority of states in the U.S.\n\n### Borrower experience: 4.0/5\n\n- **Rate transparency:** While you won\u2019t see your APR until you receive your offer, Aven only performs a \u201csoft pull\u201d on your credit report, which doesn\u2019t affect your credit score. (If you do accept the offer, a hard inquiry follows, which can temporarily impact your score.)\n- **Convenience:** Borrowers can use their Aven card to purchase anything wherever Visa cards are accepted. However, it can\u2019t be used for cash withdrawals from an ATM or bank.\n- **Customer service:** The application process can be completed completely online and if you need support, Aven is reachable by phone, email, online form, online chat and text message.\n\nBorrowers can use their card for purchases everywhere Visa is accepted and they offer multiple support options, giving Aven a 4 out of 5 for borrower experience.\n\n## Aven\u2019s reputation\n\nWhile it\u2019s a relative newcomer in the home equity lending space, Aven gets a 4.9 out of 5 review on Trustpilot.\n\n### What consumers say about Aven\n\nDespite a few digs about \u201cdelayed response times,\u201d customer reviews are largely glowing for Aven on Bankrate, especially for the \u201cfast,\u201d \u201csimple\u201d application process: \u201cSo easy to do, it's a no brainer for homeowners.\u201d\n\n## How to qualify for a HELOC card with Aven\n\nAven lets you take out as much as 89 percent of your home\u2019s equity. You will also need to have a FICO and a Vantage credit score of at least 640; customers with higher scores will get better rates.\n\nYou can get the card with equity tied to either a primary residence, second home or investment property, but the designated property can only have one mortgage attached to it at the time you apply.\n\nIf you obtain a credit line higher than $100,000, you\u2019ll also need to add Aven and Coastal Community Bank as beneficiaries on your homeowners insurance policy.\n\n## How to apply with Aven\n\nYou can apply for an Aven HELOC card on Aven\u2019s website, email them at [support@aven.com](mailto:support@aven.com) or call 415-582-6613. The application process typically takes just 15 minutes, according to the website. Checking just to see if you qualify for the card will not affect your credit score.\n\nLightbulb Icon\n\nBankrate insight\n\nYou can tap into your home equity \u2014 the difference between your home's worth and what you owe on your mortgage \u2014 with a home equity loan or a HELOC. With those funds, you can tackle a variety of expenses, like debt consolidation or home renovations.\n\nHowever, before you dive in, it's important to figure out your loan-to-value ratio (LTV). Lenders use your LTV to determine how much of your equity stake you can actually borrow. (It\u2019s typically 80 percent, although some lenders allow you to access as much as 90 percent.) The amount of equity they\u2019ll let you tap is one consideration when choosing a lender. Be it a retail bank, online lender or credit union, it may offer different [home equity loan rates](https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/get-the-best-heloc-rate/) and terms, too.

    "text": "Now that you understand what a HELOC Card is, let\u2019s dive into how it works. This article also explains where you can use your card and how it differs from the credit cards in your wallet. How to get a HELOC Card To use a traditional HELOC, you typically need to transfer funds to a checking account before making purchases or use special checks issued to you by the lender. This process can be complicated, time-consuming and frustrating. Some lenders will instead give you a HELOC Card to use at your convenience so you can access your funds immediately. However, there are several requirements to be eligible to apply, including: proving you have a steady income, being listed on your home\u2019s title, having a certain credit score and possessing a valid ID. If you meet the requirements, the application process typically looks something like this: Complete the online application, which asks questions about yourself and your home Verify your income by providing pay stubs or a company verification letter Meet with a notary to sign required documents Receive your card within a few business days Where can HELOC funds be used? Once your card arrives in the mail, you can start making purchases with it right away. You can use your card at any merchant that accepts major credit cards, like Visa and MasterCard. Experts recommend using a HELOC Card for purchases that help increase wealth over the long run. For example, many homeowners tend to use their funds on home improvements or remodeling, which can significantly increase the property\u2019s value. You can also use the card to transfer balances from personal loans or other credit cards. While there are no restrictions on what products or services you can purchase with a HELOC Card, financial advisors typically advise against using your card on frivolous items or experiences, such as vacations or a new car, which are unlikely to increase your wealth. These types of purchases could even make it harder to pay off your HELOC balance in the future. How to pay for charges made on a HELOC Card Every month, you will receive a statement with your charges, much like you do with a traditional credit card. The monthly bill for a HELOC Card from Aven, for example, consists of 1% of the principal balance plus finance and interest charges on the average daily balance during your last billing cycle. If you choose to pay only your minimum balance each month, it can take you a very long time to pay your balance back. You can choose to pay more than the minimum or to make payments more often than once a month if you'd like to pay down your debt sooner. If you can't pay your monthly bill on time, you will likely incur a late fee. How is a HELOC Card different from a credit card? While a HELOC Card is used in a similar way as a regular credit card, they are not the same. The main difference is that a HELOC Card uses your home\u2019s equity to secure the loan, while a credit card doesn\u2019t require any collateral. Consequently, HELOC Cards have much lower interest rates than credit cards. However, unlike with a credit card, the rate is usually variable, meaning it moves up and down based on a benchmark rate. Are you looking for a HELOC Card? Aven is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back. Aven is the world's first home equity-backed credit card and combines the low interest rates of a home equity line of credit with the flexibility of a credit card. Click here to learn more!",

Despite the stated minimum credit score of 640, we\u2019ve observed that applicants with scores below 720 have a much lower chance of being approved and are better off [seeking alternatives to HELOCs](https://lendedu.com/blog/home-equity-loans-lines-of-credit-alternatives/) in general.\n\n![Aven logo](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Aven-logo-e1727891899813.png)\n\nBest customer reviews\n\n4.8 /5\n\n[View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/l5jxbby19yz1xjgv5e/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end)\n\nHELOC\n\n- Offers lowest rate guarantee\n- Optional debt protection program through Securian\n- Approval in as little as 15 minutes\n- Excellent customer reviews from more than 3,800 customers\n- 100% digital application process\n- Increases the credit line for select customers\n- Automated appraisals\n- High maximum loan-to-value ratio (LTV)\n- Three-day funding after signing\n- Fixed interest rates from start to finish\n- Check your rate with no credit impact\n\n- Short draw period\n- First-draw fee of 4.90%\n- Only available in 32 states\\*\n\n| | |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Rates (APR)** | 6.99% \u2013 15.49% |\n| **Loan amounts** | $5,000 \u2013 $400,000 |\n| **Repayment terms** | 5, 10, 15, or 30 years |\n| **Min. credit score** | 640 |\n| **Funding time** | As little as 3 days after signing |\n\n\\*Not currently available in Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Washington, and West Virginia\n\nKeep reading to see how an Aven HELOC uses technology to make borrowing simpler and faster\u2014and to decide if it\u2019s right for you.\n\nTable of Contents Skip to Section\n\n- [How an Aven HELOC works](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#how)\n- [Draws and repayment](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#draw)\n- [Unique benefits](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#benefits)\n- [More about Aven HELOCs](https://lendedu.com/blog/aven-heloc-review/#eligible)\n\n## Aven HELOC at a glance\n\nAvenCash offers competitive rates, flexible repayment terms, and a generous maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Here\u2019s a closer look at the Aven HELOC highlights.\n\n| **Terms** | **Details** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rates (APR) | 6.99% \u2013 15.49% fixed |\n| HELOC amounts | $5,000 \u2013 $400,000 |\n| Minimum draw amount | Full HELOC amount |\n| Draw period | 5 years |\n| Term lengths | 5, 10, 15, or 30 years |\n| Origination (first-draw) fee | 4.90% |\n| Application fee | $0 |\n| Minimum credit score | 640 |\n| Max loan-to-value ratio | 89% |\n| Unique features | Automated appraisals; lowest rate guarantee; debt protection program; credit line increases for select customers |\n\n## How does an Aven HELOC work?\n\nAvenCash combines tech-infused applications and appraisals with borrower-friendly features that rival what you\u2019ll find with competing [home equity companies](https://lendedu.com/blog/list-of-home-equity-companies/). These features include:\n\n- **Instant prequalification**: Aven begins every application with an initial screening. You\u2019ll know within seconds if you\u2019re preapproved, and go from application all the way to closing in 15 minutes.\n- **Automatic income verification**: Aven uses a variety of sources to automatically verify your income, which makes the process quick and easy. Some customers may be asked to connect your bank account or manually upload proof of income.\n- **No property restrictions**: Primary residence? No problem. Investment property? Bring it on. New build? That\u2019s fine, too. Aven considers every property, even those held in a trust.\n- **Minimal insurance requirements**: Aven doesn\u2019t require proof of insurance unless your home is in a flood zone or your credit line is more than $100,000.\n- **Digital appraisals and notarization:** You can complete the entire HELOC process from a phone or computer. Aven uses automated valuation models (AVMs), which rely on recent sale information, current-year tax assessments, and other data to [determine your home value](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-is-home-value-determined-for-heloc/), and its online notaries help you close on your HELOC 100% online. No signing of paper docs is needed.\n- **Fast funding**: You can start using your HELOC three business days after signing.\n\nIn addition, **all AvenCash HELOCs come with fixed rates**. While some lenders let you convert variable rates to fixed rates, only a few offer fixed rates for your entire term. Fixed rates provide stability and predictability in your monthly payment\u2014it won\u2019t fluctuate unless you withdraw additional funds or pay down your outstanding balance.\n\n![](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/plugins/lendeducom-gutenberg-blocks/src/assets/img/readmore.svg)\n\nRead More\n\n[What is a home equity line of credit?](https://lendedu.com/blog/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit/)\n\n## How do you draw from and repay an Aven HELOC?\n\nAven lets you [pull from your HELOC](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-does-draw-period-work-on-heloc/) as often as you need over five years. However, it\u2019s important to note that Aven requires you to draw the full HELOC amount at origination.\n\nSo, while you can redraw from your line anytime during the five-year draw period, you\u2019ll need to repay some of the balance to free up funds before making additional withdrawals.\n\nOnce you enter [HELOC repayment](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-does-heloc-repayment-work/), Aven allows you to customize your repayment period anywhere from five to 30 years to pay off your credit line.\n\n## Do Aven HELOCs come with any unique borrower benefits?\n\nIn addition to the features and rates that make Aven\u2019s HELOC a solid competitor in the home equity marketplace, the company offers some unique benefits that we find valuable for HELOC borrowers. These include:\n\n- **Lowest rate guarantee:** If you qualify with other HELOC lenders and can get a lower rate elsewhere, let Aven know, and it will beat the offer or send you $100.\n- **Refinancing available:** Homeowners with a second lien (like an existing HELOC or [home equity loan](https://lendedu.com/blog/what-is-a-home-equity-loan/)) can refinance it into an Aven HELOC. There are no origination fees or transfer fees to refinance.\n- **Automatic credit line increases:** If you make on-time payments and/or your home equity increases, Aven will automatically invite you for a credit line increase.\n- **Debt protection through Securian:** Aven offers a unique program in which borrowers can pay a monthly fee ranging from $0.92 to $1.75 per $1,000 of HELOC balance\u2014up to $50,000. If you become involuntarily unemployed (meaning you are laid off or let go from your job), Securian will cover six months of minimum payments up to $1,000 per month.\n\n## Who\u2019s eligible for an Aven HELOC?\n\nQualifying for an Aven HELOC hinges primarily on your [credit score](https://lendedu.com/blog/credit-score-needed-home-equity-loans/), built-up equity, and location.\n\nAs with most lenders, Aven needs to see that you can handle additional debt and that your home\u2019s value will hold steady until that debt is repaid.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Aven accepts joint applications, which could be helpful if you apply with a spouse, for example, with a higher credit score.\n\nAven doesn\u2019t lend in every state, however. Here are Aven\u2019s eligibility criteria and residency requirements in greater detail:\n\n| **Requirements** | **Details** |\n| --- | --- |\n| Eligible properties | Primary residences and investment properties |\n| State of residence | Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming |\n| Maximum loan-to-value (LTV) | 89% |\n| Maximum debt-to-income | Not disclosed |\n| Minimum credit score | 640 |\n| Minimum income | Not disclosed |\n\n## What are the costs and fees of an Aven HELOC?\n\nYou won\u2019t pay many fees with Aven, but its HELOC isn\u2019t entirely fee-free. **While Aven doesn\u2019t charge application or appraisal fees, it does levy a 4.90% first-draw fee, which is essentially an origination fee**. Aven also assesses a $29 late fee on its home equity card, though it\u2019s unclear if this applies to AvenCash.\n\nHowever, fees are only one piece of the HELOC affordability puzzle. These fees work in tandem with your interest rate to create your annual percentage rate (APR). Your APR reflects the true premium you pay for your credit line, so locking in the lowest possible APR is imperative.\n\nTo better illustrate how APR can influence your borrowing cost, let\u2019s say that you withdraw $50,000 from your HELOC at an 11% APR. Here\u2019s how much your HELOC would cost over time:\n\n![Infographic showing how APR can influence borrowing cost.](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcb25g1LtEo-kbiI6k7EzoIkL0_SJOwQTyjQ-kVI25QaZfTk9d4u22Gf1JuvxwlmaJolZXGNFSJIJa7wEJ9g0pCa3zIeq2R2APXFvLhs7UQ9PAsE4_Pe8d6dvm-FtpKYgpVR9KetxA6NAe2ra9_FZ0-Nlo?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nWhat started as a $50,000 balance ballooned into a six-figure price tag because of your 11% APR. But what if you held out for a better rate and qualified for a 9% APR instead? How might that change your payments and overall borrowing cost?\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXe5uFidA5GimocFg2duH_EjR8H1VydxvXSTen9tXS9JhKawHYYJPw59-qBmV5XTkoGCtBgesakhAPOz47jbNqEt2lyAiRl5f3bSKlyWK3NQ0_skxu9bMFNjVioskgX4FVXifVgLH8msS_iBSwgg4T9ohlo?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nIf we look just at your monthly payments, particularly your payments once your draw period ends, it\u2019s easy to miss how influential your APR really is.\n\nHowever, we can see your APR\u2019s cumulative impact when we zoom out. Not only are your monthly payments more affordable at the lower rate, but you\u2019ve also saved $11,531 over the life of your HELOC.\n\n## How does your home\u2019s value affect your terms?\n\nIn addition to your credit score, Aven\u2019s automated underwriting process also\u00a0[factors in your home equity](https://www.aven.com/support/article/360061758811#:~:text=an%20applicant%27s%20income%2C-,equity,-%2C%20credit%2C%20and%20debt)\u00a0and, by extension, your home\u2019s value. Generally speaking, **lower home values and lower equity translate to lower credit limits, higher rates, or both**.\n\nThis is where LTV comes into play. This ratio compares what you owe on your home to what it\u2019s worth. Aven accepts up to an 89% LTV, so your combined home-secured debt can\u2019t exceed 89% of your home\u2019s value.\n\nThat home-secured debt includes any existing financing, like your mortgage, as well as your new HELOC. Say, for instance, that you owe $150,000 on a $300,000 home. Here\u2019s how Aven might calculate [how much you can borrow with a HELOC](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-much-can-i-borrow-on-heloc/) in light of its LTV threshold:\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf8laOyBZE4hyFaQjraHA0UXi07mLGHaRsM_J8Iwi5FjB-bJ9qiyKU1SMadNcicL6s8UF5oV9gQfMWYhwhdCyRV0vWypKluLfrbPhgulFnmIIsItqw4H5jz-RXbxysOJCxuzcX7PHtKQPMQZdfm3estd1g?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nBut what if Aven determined your home value to be slightly higher? Take a look below to see how much more you could borrow if your home appraised at $325,000 instead:\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdkkXz_Rr33A4nn6_basjCc-E7EIuCDb_-K-KH48e3wkeyF18o-2lU3TICaBZcXS-hZ6rWZG8EMoQS0Vo68dCePXyy_jcxJmNYIr8zZrRiBCK_2GP_5F0v-5_sHNOqX09krx-rxDln9ev3p1Sfly6_7w3YC?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\nIn our first example, $117,000 was the largest HELOC you could get without surpassing the 89% cap. With the increased property value in our second example, your potential HELOC limit went up by $22,250.\n\nBefore you rush to remodel your kitchen, we should mention that virtual appraisals don\u2019t always capture improvements like these. That\u2019s because these appraisals rely on tax data and recent selling prices of nearby homes, not necessarily a physical examination of your property.\n\nRather than investing in renovations you weren\u2019t otherwise planning, you may see better results\u2014both to your HELOC limit and your long-term financial position\u2014by reducing your mortgage balance instead.\n\n## Pros & cons of Aven HELOCs\n\nPros\n\n- High maximum LTV\n\nAven\u2019s 89% LTV threshold makes its HELOC more accessible to more homeowners. It also means you could open a larger HELOC than you\u2019d qualify for elsewhere.\n\n- Fixed rates\n\nWith Aven, your HELOC rate will never change, so you\u2019ll know what to expect month after month.\n\n- Few fees\n\nUnlike some of its competitors, Aven doesn\u2019t charge application, appraisal, or notary fees. You won\u2019t pay an annual fee, either.\n\n- Customizable repayment options\n\nAven offers four different repayment periods, and you can choose the term that best suits your finances.\n\n- Completely virtual application and appraisal\n\nYou\u2019ll forego the time and hassle of scheduling a traditional appraisal with Aven. You could apply and get approved in as little as 15 minutes.\n\n- Unique borrower benefits\n\nFrom its lowest rate guarantee to its debt protection program, Aven offers borrowers unique benefits you can\u2019t find with other lenders.\n\n\nCons\n\n- Virtual appraisals aren\u2019t always accurate\n\nWhile convenient, automated appraisals aren\u2019t as thorough as in-person valuations. Because it can\u2019t catch everything, Aven\u2019s system might undervalue your home.\n\n- Not available everywhere\n\nAven only lends in 32 states, rendering many homeowners ineligible for its HELOC.\n\n- Limited draw period\n\nAven\u2019s draw period is considerably shorter than what you might get with another lender, which is only five years.\n\n- Full amount is drawn at origination\n\nAven requires borrowers to draw their entire HELOC amount initially, meaning you must repay some of the balance within that five-year draw period to redraw funds as needed.\n\n- No introductory rates or rate discounts\n\nSome HELOC companies offer perks like a reduced rate for your first 12 months or when you sign up for autopay. Aven, however, isn\u2019t one of them.\n\n\n## Is Aven a reputable lender?\n\n**Aven\u2019s thousands of positive Trustpilot reviews and an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) certainly lend the company credibility**.\n\nWhile most of Aven\u2019s existing reviews center on its HELOC card, we can use those reviews to infer the service quality you\u2019ll experience with its traditional HELOC. Here\u2019s a closer look at how past customers rate the lender:\n\n| | | |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Source | Customer rating | Number of reviews |\n| Trustpilot | 4.9 stars | 3,811 |\n| Better Business Bureau | 1 star | 7 |\n\nCollected on August 30, 2024.\n\nDespite the one-star customer rating on the site, we consider Aven\u2019s A+ rating from the BBB a significant endorsement of its reliability. With a limited sample size of just seven reviews, we weigh those reviews less heavily than the 3,793 reviews on Trustpilot, where Aven boasts an impressive 4.9-star rating.\n\nThe combination of an A+ BBB rating and the overwhelmingly positive Trustpilot feedback is what led us to designate Aven\u2019s HELOC as the best for customer reviews.\n\nEfficiency and clear communication are common threads throughout Aven\u2019s Trustpilot reviews. Many borrowers applaud the company\u2019s quick application process and speak highly of its customer support team.\n\nOf course, no lender is perfect. Aven\u2019s lowest ratings come from customers frustrated by a lack of clear communication. One reviewer reported getting mixed messages regarding their approval, while another shared that their HELOC card was frozen unexpectedly.\n\n## Does Aven have a customer service team?\n\nWhether you\u2019re seeking general information or have a specific question, Aven\u2019s team is ready to help. The San Francisco-based company offers multiple ways to get in touch:\n\n- **Email**: Connect with the Aven team by emailing [\\[email\u00a0protected\\]](https://lendedu.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#cebdbbbebea1bcba8eafb8aba0e0ada1a3).\n- **Contact form**: Send a message to Aven\u2019s representatives directly from the website.\n- **Phone**: Call Aven at [415-582-6613](tel:415-582-6613) to leave a voice message. Alternatively, you can [schedule a callback](https://aven.com/call) online.\n\nAven doesn\u2019t list its hours of operation, and it encourages homeowners to use email for faster communication. If you prefer to speak with a live human, consider scheduling a callback instead.\n\n## How to apply for an Aven HELOC\n\nAven\u2019s tech-powered HELOC application process is just as innovative as its product offerings. Here\u2019s how it works:\n\n1. **Enter your phone number to start the application**. Alternatively, you can enter your Aven invite code if you have one.\n2. **Tell Aven how much you need to borrow**. You\u2019ll also tell Aven how you plan to use your credit line.\n3. **Provide your contact details and identifying information**. This includes your date of birth and the last four digits of your Social Security number. If you\u2019re applying with another person, you\u2019ll also enter their information.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdQq2Yj2vKOqDLmkbC6JpgpyyfL_WskxdA-bpUX6BFu3Gypl81WFEdW6KMFusEurKGSRp6wRsTiiWKDULDXHBhHcbK97e9ZPtIfTYJr5_beqx_DxSe0uiNwP1RvyE2Kd1FjozDb8d3fqpg88yYCDUyv4vFO?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\n1. **View your prequalified offers**. At this stage, you haven\u2019t consented to a hard credit pull. You\u2019re simply getting Aven\u2019s preliminary approval and choosing the potential HELOC terms that work best for you.\n2. **Verify your income**. Aven automatically verifies the majority of its customers\u2019 income when you apply. Some customers may be asked to either link your bank account with Plaid or send in documents like W-2s or 1099s for manual review.\n\n![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeopdNOh-WyLQpZnRlNj2Z6Dzty5zTxtkvyPkQXTk-DbS8e8iGxhurP4nsMgKi5EuBbF9x97CNy07K5gJp23a0JY619tsxwxHwlTdXr1h4pJjzVD29gKtZwkeq-ocl75OWwCLpfKd2ZTyK7iRweZ1lyBkw?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q)\n\n1. **Submit your application**.Now, you\u2019ll give Aven permission to run your credit and present you with a final HELOC offer.\n2. **Schedule your notary session**. If approved, Aven will connect you with an online notary to review and sign your documents.\n\nAfter reading your HELOC agreement, prepare to hang tight through the mandatory [three-day waiting period](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/home-equity-loans-and-home-equity-lines-credit#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Three%2DDay,cancel%20the%20deal%20without%20penalty.). As soon as this window passes, Aven will fund your HELOC, and you\u2019ll have access to your new credit line.\n\n## Aven HELOC alternatives\n\nFor many homeowners, Aven may be the clear winner, and for good reason. Still, it\u2019s wise to consider your options before committing to a lender. Here are three of the [best HELOC lenders](https://lendedu.com/blog/home-equity-line-of-credit/) available:\n\n| **Company** | **Best for\u2026** | **Rating**(0-5) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ![Figure logo](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/figure_refi.png) 4.9 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/figure-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best overall | 4.9 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/figure-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\n| ![](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/FourLeaf_logo_EHL-NMLS_FCU-1.png) 4.7 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/bethpage-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best for large HELOCs | 4.7 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/bethpage-heloc-o/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\n| ![lendingtree logo](https://lendedu.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/lendingtree-logo.png) 4.5 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/lendingtree-heloc-heloc/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) | Best for comparison shopping | 4.5 [View Rates](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/lendingtree-heloc-heloc/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end) |\n\nWhile these companies share commonalities with Aven, each one offers distinct advantages that Aven doesn\u2019t:\n\n- [**Figure**](https://lendedu.com/blog/figure-home-equity-loan-review/) is available in more states. It also allows LTVs up to 95%.\n- [**FourLeaf**](https://lendedu.com/blog/bethpage-home-equity-review/) boasts a 10-year draw period and HELOCs up to $1 million.\n- [**LendingTree**](https://lendedu.com/blog/lendingtree-home-equity-loans-review/) shows you multiple prequalified offers in one place.\n\nThose prequalified offers are key to choosing the right lender. They tell you instantly which companies can give you the HELOC you\u2019re looking for and which ones can\u2019t.\n\nSince prequalifying doesn\u2019t hurt your credit, we recommend checking your rates with at least four lenders. Compare each offer, paying close attention to APRs, credit limits, and term lengths.\n\nIt may be tempting to accept the first HELOC offer you get. But by slowing down and carefully evaluating your options, you\u2019ll boost your odds of locking in not just any HELOC but a HELOC that\u2019s virtually tailor-made for you.\n\n## How we rated Aven\n\nWe designed LendEDU\u2019s editorial rating system to help readers find companies that offer the best HELOCs. Our system awards higher ratings to companies with affordable solutions, positive customer reviews, and online transparency of benefits and terms.\n\nWe compared Aven to several home equity lenders, using hundreds of data points from company websites, public disclosures, customer reviews, and direct communication with company representatives. We weighted, scored, and combined each factor to produce a final editorial rating. This rating is expressed on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest possible score.

See the various options to get cash from Aven card Published Oct 27, 2023 | 1 min read Aven cardholders can use their Aven Card for purchase transactions wherever VISA cards are accepted. Aven cardholders can transfer cash directly from their Aven account to another bank account \u2013 it is called a CashOut. CashOuts are initiated within 2 business days of the request. For security reasons, there is a $50,000 daily limit, you will need to verify ownership of the bank account, and Aven does not allow cash to be withdrawn from a bank or ATM. Start a Cash Out. Transfer fee may apply. To transfer balance from a high interest credit card to the Aven card, cardholders can request a balance transfer (BT) to their credit card. BTs are initiated within 5 business days of the request. Transfer fee may apply.",

It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Percent Sign Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/rateIcon.bdf34906.svg)\n\nDo you offer a fixed rate?\n\nFor Cash Outs, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. One time 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.[4](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_4)\n\n![Calculator Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/paymentIcon.c7d44db7.svg)\n\nWhat is my monthly payment?\n\nMonthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. [See Payment Calculator](https://www.aven.com/PaymentCalculator).\n\n![Cash Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/cashIcon.12b80785.svg)\n\nCan I get cash too?\n\nYes! You can directly deposit cash from your Aven card to your bank account at the same low rate. A 2.5% transfer fee applies.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n![Meter Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/creditScoreIcon.57152ad7.svg)\n\nDoes this affect my credit score?\n\nChecking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check.\n\n![Price Tag Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/feesIcon.54015658.svg)\n\nAre there any fees?\n\nWe try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don\u2019t make the minimum payment.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1)\n\n##### More Questions...\n\nSearch\n\n# Become an Expert\n\n## Grow your knowledge with our educational articles written by our team of experts.\n\n[![Can you get cash from Aven card?](https://www.aven.com/img/can-you-get-cash-aven-card.b4532e86.webp)\\\n**Can you get cash from Aven card?** \\\n\\\nYes!
