Cash outs may have a fixed rate option. See your offer for details. The variable rate varies based on an Index (Prime Rate published in the Wall Street Journal or the Federal Funds Target Rate Upper Limit set by the Federal Reserve). This is outside Aven's control. As the Index shifts up or down, so will the APR on the Aven Card and any other variable-rate credit cards, lines, and loans.

The payment is calculated so that the entire amount of the plan and the interest is paid off by the end of the selected term. For payment estimates, please visit [https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator](https://www.aven.com/paymentcalculator) - How do you compute my minimum due every month? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg) For revolving balance plans, the minimum monthly payment is 1% of the principal plus the monthly interest rate on the outstanding balance. For fixed monthly payment plans, the monthly payment amount is the same every month. If an account has multiple plans, each plan's minimum payment is added to calculate the total minimum payment due for the entire account. For payment estimates, please visit [https://aven.com/paymentCalculator](https://aven.com/paymentCalculator). - Is there a prepayment penalty? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg) There is no a prepayment penalty on an Aven Card account. Cardholders can pay more than the minimum due each month, make extra lump-sum payments, or make a full payoff payment.

Cardholders can also find more details about their Account Agreement, here [https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails](https://my.aven.com/card/accountDetails) Important Note: If a Cardholder intends to payoff an account, the funds must be sent through wire transfer. If any other method of funding is used, there will be a 60 day wait period before the lien is released. Aven is unable to waive or shorten this wait period. - How is interest calculated on the Aven account? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg) Interest calculation on the Aven card depends on the type of balance (purchase, balance transfer, cash out, fixed payment plan balance, etc) on an account. Most accounts have several balance types, so the total interest is the sum of the interest calculated on each balance type. - For purchases, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365). This interest is waived for new purchases if the entire purchase balance is paid in full by the due date shown on the next statement. If the purchase balance is not paid in full, in the next cycle, there will be interest for 2 cycles on the purchase, starting from the date of the purchase. - For Balance Transfers and Cash-outs that are revolving plans, interest accrues daily at the daily interest rate (APR divided by 365), starting when the Cash-Out or Balance Transfer is disbursed. - Any balances in a fixed monthly payment plan either have interest accrued daily at the daily interest rate of the plan (Plan APR divided by 365) or have a fixed monthly fee in place of interest. These charges are disclosed at the time of plan creation. In addition to interest, the monthly payment also includes repayment of a portion of the principal balance. For Purchases, Balance Transfers, and Cash Outs on revolving plans, 1% of the outstanding balance is the principal portion of the minimum due. For fixed monthly payment plans, the part of the fixed payment that is not interest or monthly fee is allocated to the principal."

For revolving balances, Aven uses the Average Daily Balance method of interest calculation. For each billing cycle, we add the interest bearing balance on each day of the cycle and divide it by the number of days in the cycle to get the Average Daily Balance for the billing cycle.

Securian's claim decision is final. - Do I need to be current on my account to file a Debt Protection claim? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg) No. You may file a claim even if you are delinquent. However, you will need to remit the Debt Protection fees owed in order to process the claim. The cardholder has active coverage if the protection has not lapsed. Please note, if a claim is successful, it will not bring your account current. - Are there any exclusions to filing a claim for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg) Debt protection is not possible in the following cases: - A customer retires, quits, or resigns - A claim occurs in first 90 days of issuance - A claim occurs on or after 70th birthday - How do I file a claim for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg) Email us at support@aven.com or go to the Debt Protection tab located in the sidebar menu of your Aven mobile application. There you will see a link to file a claim. You will be routed to Securian Financial - our claims administrator - to provide details related to your job loss event and submit documentation. Once a decision has been made, Securian Financial will notify you and Aven and issue a payment to Aven under the contractual liability policy. Please note that the cancellation date would be effective as of the date of unemployment. - How are Debt Protection fees calculated? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg) The monthly rate charged is $0.92 per $1,000 of balances for single accounts and $1.75 per $1,000 of balances for joint accounts. For example, if you have $30,000 of outstanding balances at your statement date, you would see a $27.60 charge as a single account holder and a $52.50 charge as a joint account holder in the following statement. Fees are always paid for balances in arrears. This fee will show up on your monthly statement as a separate charge. As long as you are current on paying these fees, you will be able to file a claim in the event of involuntary job loss."

Are there any limitations with Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg) Debt Protection covers participating customers up to $50,000 in total payments and up to $1,000 in monthly payments for up to 6 months. Customers can file for multiple occurrences of involuntary job loss after a 6 month waiting period after a prior occurrence. As an example, say a customer has $50,000 of balances outstanding at a 12% APR at the time of a qualifying job loss event. Their minimum monthly payment is $1,000 consisting of $500 in principal and $500 in accrued interest. Under the Debt Protection program, this customer would be eligible to cancel up to 6 months of minimum monthly payments and stay current on their account. This customer would also be able to file another claim in the event of a subsequent job loss event. If the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again within 6 months of returning to full-time work, this will be a continuation of the first event. But if the customer becomes involuntarily unemployed again more than 6 months after they return to full-time work, this will be a new event. In this scenario, they would have $9,000 in eligible coverage remaining. Please note, the $1,000 monthly limit may not be sufficient to cover your minimum monthly payment to keep you current. In this event, a customer would have to pay the difference between their minimum monthly payment and the $1,000 to stay current. - Is Debt Protection considered an insurance product?

How does Debt Protection work? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg) No, Debt Protection is not an insurance protection. Anyone who elects to join will sign an addendum to their loan agreement with Aven. In the event of involuntary job loss, Aven will cancel up to six months of a borrower\u2019s monthly payments per occurrence of job loss if the claim is approved. Aven maintains a contractual liability policy and administrative services agreement with Securian Financial. In the event of a Debt Protection claim, Securian would approve it and reimburse funds to Aven Financial. - Who is eligible for Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg) In order to qualify, you must: - Be under 70 years old - Actively work a minimum of 24 hours per week - Not be self-employed - What is Debt Protection? ![down](https://www.aven.com/img/down.bb266b57.svg) For a small monthly fee, you can protect yourself and your home for up to six months per occurrence of involuntary job loss. Aven makes no money from this offering - we offer it strictly for the benefit of any customers who are worried about potentially losing their home. Please note, this product is only meant to help you manage your Aven card. Aven may still foreclose if the max monthly claim payment from debt protection is not sufficient to cover the minimum monthly payment due. Additionally, your first lien holder may still foreclose if you fall into default on mortgage payments. SHOW MORE ##### Can't find what you need?

Aven is a credit card that lets you use your home equity to get really low rates. ![House Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/howIcon.05e1b942.svg) How does it work? Aven combines the convenience of a credit card with the savings of a home equity line of credit (HELOC). It works like any other credit card where you can make everyday purchases and earn unlimited 2% cash back.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1) ![Percent Sign Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/rateIcon.bdf34906.svg) Do you offer a fixed rate? For Cash Outs, you have the option of fixed monthly payments (Aven Simple Loan). Lock in your payments for 5 or 10 years. One time 2.5% fee per cash out applies. Available right in the app.[4](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_4) ![Calculator Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/paymentIcon.c7d44db7.svg) What is my monthly payment? Monthly payments work like a standard credit card. It is calculated as 1% of the principal balance, plus monthly interest, plus any fees. [See Payment Calculator](https://www.aven.com/PaymentCalculator). ![Cash Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/cashIcon.12b80785.svg) Can I get cash too?"

A 2.5% transfer fee applies.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1) ![Meter Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/creditScoreIcon.57152ad7.svg) Does this affect my credit score? Checking your offer does not affect your credit score. Only once you schedule with our notary to finalize will we do a hard credit check. ![Price Tag Icon](https://www.aven.com/img/feesIcon.54015658.svg) Are there any fees? We try to reduce as many of the fees as possible. No annual, sign-up, or pre-payment fees. There is a 2.5% fee on Cash Outs and Balance Transfers and a $29 late fee if you don\u2019t make the minimum payment.[1](https://www.aven.com/education/#footnote_1) ##### More Questions...

    "text": "Now that you understand what a HELOC Card is, let\u2019s dive into how it works. This article also explains where you can use your card and how it differs from the credit cards in your wallet. How to get a HELOC Card To use a traditional HELOC, you typically need to transfer funds to a checking account before making purchases or use special checks issued to you by the lender. This process can be complicated, time-consuming and frustrating. Some lenders will instead give you a HELOC Card to use at your convenience so you can access your funds immediately. However, there are several requirements to be eligible to apply, including: proving you have a steady income, being listed on your home\u2019s title, having a certain credit score and possessing a valid ID. If you meet the requirements, the application process typically looks something like this: Complete the online application, which asks questions about yourself and your home Verify your income by providing pay stubs or a company verification letter Meet with a notary to sign required documents Receive your card within a few business days Where can HELOC funds be used? Once your card arrives in the mail, you can start making purchases with it right away. You can use your card at any merchant that accepts major credit cards, like Visa and MasterCard. Experts recommend using a HELOC Card for purchases that help increase wealth over the long run. For example, many homeowners tend to use their funds on home improvements or remodeling, which can significantly increase the property\u2019s value. You can also use the card to transfer balances from personal loans or other credit cards. While there are no restrictions on what products or services you can purchase with a HELOC Card, financial advisors typically advise against using your card on frivolous items or experiences, such as vacations or a new car, which are unlikely to increase your wealth. These types of purchases could even make it harder to pay off your HELOC balance in the future. How to pay for charges made on a HELOC Card Every month, you will receive a statement with your charges, much like you do with a traditional credit card. The monthly bill for a HELOC Card from Aven, for example, consists of 1% of the principal balance plus finance and interest charges on the average daily balance during your last billing cycle. If you choose to pay only your minimum balance each month, it can take you a very long time to pay your balance back. You can choose to pay more than the minimum or to make payments more often than once a month if you'd like to pay down your debt sooner. If you can't pay your monthly bill on time, you will likely incur a late fee. How is a HELOC Card different from a credit card? While a HELOC Card is used in a similar way as a regular credit card, they are not the same. The main difference is that a HELOC Card uses your home\u2019s equity to secure the loan, while a credit card doesn\u2019t require any collateral. Consequently, HELOC Cards have much lower interest rates than credit cards. However, unlike with a credit card, the rate is usually variable, meaning it moves up and down based on a benchmark rate. Are you looking for a HELOC Card? Aven is a credit card in the front, home equity in the back. Aven is the world's first home equity-backed credit card and combines the low interest rates of a home equity line of credit with the flexibility of a credit card. Click here to learn more!"

Credit cards have evolved much over the years, offering security, easy cash flow and lucrative rewards to cardholders. What they haven\u2019t historically been so good at is addressing personal finance needs as they relate to your rent or mortgage. Recently, though, homeowners have a specific credit card to get excited about. The Aven Home card is designed to be a cross between a rewards card and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Given the unique hybrid nature of this offer, I think it has the potential to change the way we think about credit cards, particularly among home owners. > BONUS TIP! > > Don\u2019t feel left out, Renters! There\u2019s a card aimed at helping you out in an all-new way as well: The [CardName](https://www.cardratings.com/cashback/aven-home-card-is-it-worth-it.html) discontinued allows you to earn rewards on your rent payments without incurring any transaction or processing fees. ## How does the Aven Home card work? When it comes to day-to-day use, the Aven card works like a regular Visa card, so you can enjoy the convenience of a credit card with the lower interest rates associated with a HELOC. It\u2019s the underwriting and fee structure of the Aven credit card that sets it apart\u2013 basically, the card utilizes your home\u2019s equity as a form of collateral to secure your credit line and lower rates. When you apply for the card, the issuer will verify your income and credit score/history as well as the equity in your home. Assuming you\u2019re approved, you\u2019ll receive the card in the mail soon after. > Home equity loan vs. Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) > > How does a HELOC differ from a home equity loan? In short: > > - A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a loan secured by the borrower\u2019s home \u2013 your home is collateral for the money you borrow. HELOCs are good for major expenses (think college or medical debt) because rates will be lowered, but this loan is only good if you can afford it, and your income is incredibly stable."

HELOCs are good for major expenses (think college or medical debt) because rates will be lowered, but this loan is only good if you can afford it, and your income is incredibly stable. > - A home equity loan is a loan of a fixed amount of money secured by your home. Upon agreeing to a home equity loan you\u2019ll agree to equal monthly payments over a set timeframe. Because this loan is a fixed amount it is a good option for one-time events \u2013 like paying down higher APR credit card debt. Just as with a HELOC your loan is secured by your home, ensuring you have amble opportunity to pay the loan back is imperative before moving forward with this option. Your monthly minimum payments will be 1% of your principal balance, plus interest and any fees. It\u2019s a setup that\u2019s fairly typical for a credit card. Where Aven differs is that you have the option to set up fixed monthly payments for balance transfers and cash outs. In that case, you won\u2019t pay interest on those transactions, but you will pay a set monthly fee. A number of mainstream banks, including Chase and Citibank, offer similar payment setups for certain purchases on their qualifying cards. \u27a4\u00a0LEARN MORE: [Credit card built-in fixed APR personal loans vs. traditional personal loans](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/debt/credit-card-built-in-fixed-apr-personal-loans-vs-traditional-personal-loans.html) If you\u2019re considering the Aven credit card as a balance transfer option, it\u2019s best to not think about it as a purchase card option until that balance is paid off. \u201cIf you\u2019re in credit card debt, stop using your cards \\[for new purchases\\],\u201d advises Beverly Harzog, consumer finance analyst and author of\u00a0\u201cThe Debt Escape Plan: How to Free Yourself from Credit Card Balances, Boost Your Credit Score, and Live Debt-Free.\u201d \u201cFocus on becoming debt-free.

You\u2019ll feel a rush of adrenaline that will help you stick with it!\u201d ## Highlights of the Aven credit card - 7.99%-15.49% variable APR on purchases, balance transfers and cash advances. Your initial rate is based on your\u00a0[credit score](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/vantagescore-vs-fico.html) - Up to a $250,000 credit limit, which is MUCH higher than the\u00a0typical card limit of around $3,952 - Offers\u00a0[balance transfers](https://www.cardratings.com/balance-transfer/what-is-a-balance-transfer.html)\u00a0and cash outs (directly deposit cash from your card to your bank account, which is similar to a\u00a0[credit card cash advance](https://www.cardratings.com/cashback/can-i-get-cash-back-when-i-buy-something-with-a-credit-card.html)) and you have the option of fixed rate monthly payments. Unlike other cards, you can also lock in your payments for five or 10 years. (One-time 2.5 % transfer fee applies for both transfers and cash outs). - You can use funds from a cash out for any purpose and, unlike almost all other credit cards that charge a higher rate for cash advances, the cash out rate is the same as the fixed purchase rate - 2% unlimited cash back on all purchases - Potentially lower fees than a traditional HELOC and a more streamlined, faster application and approval process ## Details of the Aven Home card ### Rewards Aven cardholders earn 2% cash back on every purchases, which is on par with other flat-rate cash-back cards and higher than the base rate of many tiered rate cash-back cards. Rewards, however, aren\u2019t terribly flexible. You can redeem your cash back for statement credit, which could save you a bit of money but won\u2019t allow you to strategically maximize the rewards as you can with some points/cash-back cards. ### Card fees"

    "text": "Rewards, however, aren\u2019t terribly flexible. You can redeem your cash back for statement credit, which could save you a bit of money but won\u2019t allow you to strategically maximize the rewards as you can with some points/cash-back cards. ### Card fees **Annual fee:** The Aven card offers a $0 annual fee option for all applicants. **Balance transfer fee:** There\u2019s a 2.5% fee for balance transfers, which is higher than the typical fee. If you REALLY need a lengthy period of time (say, more than 18 months) to pay off a chunk of debt, it _might_ be worth it. That said, there are plenty of balance transfer credit cards out there that offer a 0% APR period (15-18 months isn\u2019t hard to find for people with excellent credit) and a fee of 3%. Taken together, that could prove a much better option for most people. **Cash advance fee:** Again, there\u2019s a 2.5% cash advance fee BUT cash advances enjoy the same interest rate as purchases, which is highly unusual. With most cards, you\u2019ll pay a higher interest rate for cash advances than for purchases and balance transfers. **Loan origination fees:** There\u2019s aren\u2019t any! This is where the card shines for people considering a HELOC. In many cases, a HELOC has some origination and processing fees to get your started; but you pay any of that with the Aven card. **APR:** The card advertises that you get \u201creally, really low rates\u201d. While I don\u2019t totally agree with the phrase \u201creally, really low rates,\u201d this card does offer a purchase rate as low as 7.99% (not an\u00a0[introductory or teaser rate](https://www.cardratings.com/financial-literacy/0-apr/best-practices-saving-with-an-intro-0-apr-card.html)). In comparison, the national average is around 20%\u00a0[according to NBC](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/credit-card-interest-rates-hit-record-high-rcna56373)."

Talk with a tax adviser about the deductibility of projects completed using your Aven card. ## Are there any potential \u2018gotchas\u2019 with the Aven card? The Aven credit card is definitely more complicated than the average card, but really only as it relates to how you qualify and what kind of payment structure you\u2019re anticipating. While this alone isn\u2019t a big cause for concern, there are other potential issues worth discussing. **1)**\u00a0There\u2019s no question that Aven card has attractive rates and a unique value proposition, but the real question is who exactly this offer is best suited for. Obviously, getting a HELOC is not a light decision, particularly since you could lose your house if you get too far behind in payments (since the HELOC is secured by your home)! \u201cAven has excellent rates because they use your home as collateral, which can be risky,\u201d explains Harzog. \u201cSo, think carefully about using the Aven card over, say, an unsecured card with rewards.\u201d"

The key takeaway here is why pay a low interest rate, when you can potentially pay no interest! \u201cThis is an interesting offer and it has some benefits if you have good credit and qualify for a low interest rate,\u201d Harzog explains. \u201cIf you have debt on high-interest credit cards, you can do a balance transfer so you can pay your balance off at a lower rate.\u201d ![quote](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%2040'%3E%3C/svg%3E) But if you have card debt and still have a very good credit score, it\u2019s better to \\[do a normal\\] balance transfer and get a 0% rate for a period of time. \u2014 Beverly Harzog, Consumer Finance Analyst ## Does Aven offer a competitive rewards program? The short answer is that Aven does offer competitive rebates, but it\u2019s not the \u201cbest of breed\u201d when compared to other cash-back offers. If you really like the 2% unlimited cash back benefit on all purchases, you should be aware that there are \u201cnormal\u201d rebate cards that offer [2% cash back on purchases (or more) with no annual fees](https://www.cardratings.com/best-credit-cards-for-cash-back-rewards.html#card3387). If you are trying to pay down debt, that extra .5% (or more) on some purchases could help you out."

If you are trying to pay down debt, that extra .5% (or more) on some purchases could help you out. \u201cPaying down debt could make my earnings go further rather than just using my cash back to buy stuff off Amazon like I\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d notes Scott Bonge, the founder of\u00a0[MyPerfectGoatee.com](https://www.myperfectgoatee.com/), and a long-term rewards credit card user. \u201cIt\u2019s really a matter of personal preference, money-management style and existing credit resources,\u201d Khalfani-Cox adds. \u201cSomeone who doesn\u2019t need a HELOC, perhaps because they already have one or don\u2019t want to draw down on that line, may be better off with a traditional 2% cash back card. \u201cBut for someone who prefers lower rates (ongoing, not intro.) and/or having the flexibility that a HELOC-type card provides, the Aven card may be more beneficial.\u201d The bottom line is that while Aven has a decent rewards program, you shouldn\u2019t apply for this offer solely based on it\u2019s rewards program. The rebates should be viewed simply as an added bonus (pun intended). > BONUS TIP! > > As is the case with other reward cards, you can not earn rebates on balance transfers and cash outs. The redemption options for Aven are limited as cash-back rebates are only redeemable as a statement credit (you can\u2019t get gift cards, a check in the mail, etc). ## Final thoughts The Aven Home card has introduced a creative way for homeowners to conveniently take advantage of their equity. I love their hybrid approach and I do believe this offer can definitely be a blessing to a certain demographic, particularly when considering the economic environment we find ourselves in."

I love their hybrid approach and I do believe this offer can definitely be a blessing to a certain demographic, particularly when considering the economic environment we find ourselves in. I also love the balance transfer and cash out feature, but would caution current and potential cardholders to remember a few \u201cold school\u201d debt reduction principles when using this new card to consolidate and/or pay down debt. \u201cIn general, I recommend people prioritize paying off their debts organically \u2014 meaning they use cash to pay it off, not another form of borrowing,\u201d Khalfani-Cox elaborates. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between a \u2018zero debt'\u201d\u2018 strategy \u2014 which seeks to eliminate debt progressively \u2014 and a \u2018shift debt\u2019 strategy, which really just pushes the debt around from one form of credit or borrowing to another. _\u201c_ Because I once had a ton of credit card debt before paying it off, I do understand the \u2018shift debt\u2019 strategy,\u201d Khalfani-Cox conitinues. \u201cIt\u2019s the same strategy, in effect, that people have used (myself included) when they do balance transfers. You get a little breathing room, maybe a 0% interest rate, and the opportunity to more aggressively attack your debts. So although a \u2018shift debt\u2019 strategy can be helpful in the short-run, it\u2019s not a viable long-term strategy to actually get rid of the debt. Ultimately, you do have to pay the piper and pay off what you owe.\u201d Ultimately, as Khalfani-Cox reminded me in a recent interview, it pays to have a set of rules for when you will use credit. Ask yourself: under what circumstances and for what types of purchases will I use this card or this form of credit \u2014 and then stick to that. By setting up some pre-established guidelines and criteria for credit usage, you\u2019ll become a lot better at managing credit wisely and avoiding the pitfall of excessive credit use. I sincerely hope these insider tips are helpful to you and would love your feedback on your personal experiences with the Aven card, balance transfers and card debt. Who knows, I may include feedback from you in a future article. Best wishes in using cards to your financial advantage!"

I called after going on the website. The app was useless for getting any kind of support. The lady seemed to know already that it was going to be related to the starbucks button.

They\u2019re not listed on CFPB but I\u2019m hoping the BBB will be enough for them to remove it off of my credit report altogether. What\u2019s worse is that there wasn\u2019t even an email that says I was approved for the card, if I hadn\u2019t used P2\u2019s account to see what I even clicked on I still wouldn\u2019t know they signed me up for a card.

I emailed them and also posted on Trustpilot (basically stole your review :)). They emailed me today that they canceled the card and deleted the account tradelines from your credit report and requested Experian to reverse the hard inquiry.\u00a0So while it\u2019s definitely really scammy what they did, at least they took care of it quickly. 0 Reply ![joe](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/62cdc6936e6d71c92931fb2ba8c7823a?s=128&d=mm&r=g)"

First batch went out shortly after this was posted on DoC, but I was starting to wonder about second batch and did get texts finally on Friday. So they did pay that one time at least and seems they are doing it again now. They did have a note about a delay right after they paid the first batch but then it disappeared (well payout history stopped working on the app). 0 Reply"

Aven uses automated valuation models (AVMs), which rely on recent sale information, current-year tax assessments, and other data to [determine your home value](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-is-home-value-determined-for-heloc/), and its online notaries help you close on your HELOC 100% online.

    "text": "[What is a home equity line of credit?](https://lendedu.com/blog/what-is-a-home-equity-line-of-credit/) ## How do you draw from and repay an Aven HELOC? Aven lets you [pull from your HELOC](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-does-draw-period-work-on-heloc/) as often as you need over five years. However, it\u2019s important to note that Aven requires you to draw the full HELOC amount at origination. So, while you can redraw from your line anytime during the five-year draw period, you\u2019ll need to repay some of the balance to free up funds before making additional withdrawals. Once you enter [HELOC repayment](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-does-heloc-repayment-work/), Aven allows you to customize your repayment period anywhere from five to 30 years to pay off your credit line. ## Do Aven HELOCs come with any unique borrower benefits? In addition to the features and rates that make Aven\u2019s HELOC a solid competitor in the home equity marketplace, the company offers some unique benefits that we find valuable for HELOC borrowers. These include: - **Lowest rate guarantee:** If you qualify with other HELOC lenders and can get a lower rate elsewhere, let Aven know, and it will beat the offer or send you $100. - **Refinancing available:** Homeowners with a second lien (like an existing HELOC or [home equity loan](https://lendedu.com/blog/what-is-a-home-equity-loan/)) can refinance it into an Aven HELOC. There are no origination fees or transfer fees to refinance. - **Automatic credit line increases:** If you make on-time payments and/or your home equity increases, Aven will automatically invite you for a credit line increase. - **Debt protection through Securian:** Aven offers a unique program in which borrowers can pay a monthly fee ranging from $0.92 to $1.75 per $1,000 of HELOC balance\u2014up to $50,000. If you become involuntarily unemployed (meaning you are laid off or let go from your job), Securian will cover six months of minimum payments up to $1,000 per month. ## Who\u2019s eligible for an Aven HELOC?"

Qualifying for an Aven HELOC hinges primarily on your [credit score](https://lendedu.com/blog/credit-score-needed-home-equity-loans/), built-up equity, and location. As with most lenders, Aven needs to see that you can handle additional debt and that your home\u2019s value will hold steady until that debt is repaid. It\u2019s worth noting that Aven accepts joint applications, which could be helpful if you apply with a spouse, for example, with a higher credit score. Aven doesn\u2019t lend in every state, however.

You won\u2019t pay many fees with Aven, but its HELOC isn\u2019t entirely fee-free. **While Aven doesn\u2019t charge application or appraisal fees, it does levy a 4.90% first-draw fee, which is essentially an origination fee**. Aven also assesses a $29 late fee on its home equity card, though it\u2019s unclear if this applies to AvenCash."

Aven also assesses a $29 late fee on its home equity card, though it\u2019s unclear if this applies to AvenCash. However, fees are only one piece of the HELOC affordability puzzle. These fees work in tandem with your interest rate to create your annual percentage rate (APR). Your APR reflects the true premium you pay for your credit line, so locking in the lowest possible APR is imperative. To better illustrate how APR can influence your borrowing cost, let\u2019s say that you withdraw $50,000 from your HELOC at an 11% APR. Here\u2019s how much your HELOC would cost over time: ![Infographic showing how APR can influence borrowing cost.](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcb25g1LtEo-kbiI6k7EzoIkL0_SJOwQTyjQ-kVI25QaZfTk9d4u22Gf1JuvxwlmaJolZXGNFSJIJa7wEJ9g0pCa3zIeq2R2APXFvLhs7UQ9PAsE4_Pe8d6dvm-FtpKYgpVR9KetxA6NAe2ra9_FZ0-Nlo?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q) What started as a $50,000 balance ballooned into a six-figure price tag because of your 11% APR. But what if you held out for a better rate and qualified for a 9% APR instead? How might that change your payments and overall borrowing cost?"

In addition to your credit score, Aven\u2019s automated underwriting process also\u00a0[factors in your home equity](https://www.aven.com/support/article/360061758811#:~:text=an%20applicant%27s%20income%2C-,equity,-%2C%20credit%2C%20and%20debt)\u00a0and, by extension, your home\u2019s value. Generally speaking, **lower home values and lower equity translate to lower credit limits, higher rates, or both**. This is where LTV comes into play. This ratio compares what you owe on your home to what it\u2019s worth. Aven accepts up to an 89% LTV, so your combined home-secured debt can\u2019t exceed 89% of your home\u2019s value. That home-secured debt includes any existing financing, like your mortgage, as well as your new HELOC. Say, for instance, that you owe $150,000 on a $300,000 home. Here\u2019s how Aven might calculate [how much you can borrow with a HELOC](https://lendedu.com/blog/how-much-can-i-borrow-on-heloc/) in light of its LTV threshold: ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXf8laOyBZE4hyFaQjraHA0UXi07mLGHaRsM_J8Iwi5FjB-bJ9qiyKU1SMadNcicL6s8UF5oV9gQfMWYhwhdCyRV0vWypKluLfrbPhgulFnmIIsItqw4H5jz-RXbxysOJCxuzcX7PHtKQPMQZdfm3estd1g?key=-Z-nPTOceLokfRQC--F06Q) But what if Aven determined your home value to be slightly higher?

With the increased property value in our second example, your potential HELOC limit went up by $22,250. Before you rush to remodel your kitchen, we should mention that virtual appraisals don\u2019t always capture improvements like these. That\u2019s because these appraisals rely on tax data and recent selling prices of nearby homes, not necessarily a physical examination of your property. Rather than investing in renovations you weren\u2019t otherwise planning, you may see better results\u2014both to your HELOC limit and your long-term financial position\u2014by reducing your mortgage balance instead. ## Pros & cons of Aven HELOCs Pros - High maximum LTV"

    "text": "Pros - High maximum LTV Aven\u2019s 89% LTV threshold makes its HELOC more accessible to more homeowners. It also means you could open a larger HELOC than you\u2019d qualify for elsewhere. - Fixed rates With Aven, your HELOC rate will never change, so you\u2019ll know what to expect month after month. - Few fees Unlike some of its competitors, Aven doesn\u2019t charge application, appraisal, or notary fees. You won\u2019t pay an annual fee, either. - Customizable repayment options Aven offers four different repayment periods, and you can choose the term that best suits your finances. - Completely virtual application and appraisal You\u2019ll forego the time and hassle of scheduling a traditional appraisal with Aven. You could apply and get approved in as little as 15 minutes. - Unique borrower benefits From its lowest rate guarantee to its debt protection program, Aven offers borrowers unique benefits you can\u2019t find with other lenders. Cons - Virtual appraisals aren\u2019t always accurate While convenient, automated appraisals aren\u2019t as thorough as in-person valuations. Because it can\u2019t catch everything, Aven\u2019s system might undervalue your home. - Not available everywhere Aven only lends in 32 states, rendering many homeowners ineligible for its HELOC. - Limited draw period Aven\u2019s draw period is considerably shorter than what you might get with another lender, which is only five years. - Full amount is drawn at origination Aven requires borrowers to draw their entire HELOC amount initially, meaning you must repay some of the balance within that five-year draw period to redraw funds as needed. - No introductory rates or rate discounts Some HELOC companies offer perks like a reduced rate for your first 12 months or when you sign up for autopay. Aven, however, isn\u2019t one of them. ## Is Aven a reputable lender? **Aven\u2019s thousands of positive Trustpilot reviews and an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau (BBB) certainly lend the company credibility**. While most of Aven\u2019s existing reviews center on its HELOC card, we can use those reviews to infer the service quality you\u2019ll experience with its traditional HELOC. Here\u2019s a closer look at how past customers rate the lender: | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | Source | Customer rating | Number of reviews | | Trustpilot | 4.9 stars | 3,811 |"

Despite the one-star customer rating on the site, we consider Aven\u2019s A+ rating from the BBB a significant endorsement of its reliability. With a limited sample size of just seven reviews, we weigh those reviews less heavily than the 3,793 reviews on Trustpilot, where Aven boasts an impressive 4.9-star rating. The combination of an A+ BBB rating and the overwhelmingly positive Trustpilot feedback is what led us to designate Aven\u2019s HELOC as the best for customer reviews. Efficiency and clear communication are common threads throughout Aven\u2019s Trustpilot reviews. Many borrowers applaud the company\u2019s quick application process and speak highly of its customer support team. Of course, no lender is perfect. Aven\u2019s lowest ratings come from customers frustrated by a lack of clear communication. One reviewer reported getting mixed messages regarding their approval, while another shared that their HELOC card was frozen unexpectedly. ## Does Aven have a customer service team?

It may be tempting to accept the first HELOC offer you get. But by slowing down and carefully evaluating your options, you\u2019ll boost your odds of locking in not just any HELOC but a HELOC that\u2019s virtually tailor-made for you. ## How we rated Aven We designed LendEDU\u2019s editorial rating system to help readers find companies that offer the best HELOCs. Our system awards higher ratings to companies with affordable solutions, positive customer reviews, and online transparency of benefits and terms. We compared Aven to several home equity lenders, using hundreds of data points from company websites, public disclosures, customer reviews, and direct communication with company representatives. We weighted, scored, and combined each factor to produce a final editorial rating. This rating is expressed on a scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest possible score. Our take is represented in our rating, recapped below. | | | | | --- | --- | --- | | Product | Best for | Our rating | | [Aven HELOC](https://go2.lendedu.com/go/l5jxbby19yz1xjgv5e/?lesource=organic&lereferrer=https%3A%2F%2Flendedu.com%2Fblog%2Faven-heloc-review%2F_end&lemeta=recap-table) | Best customer reviews | 4.8/5 | 4.8AvenCash HELOC"

    "text": "Keith East Tennessee \u00a0(Feb 23, 2025) [Read 31 customer reviews for Aven](https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/reviews/aven/#customer-ratings-and-reviews) Editor\u2019s take Aven seems to be something of a pioneer, with its unique product: a credit card whose line of credit directly ties into your home equity. While certainly convenient, the card is best suited for highly responsible borrowers, as it\u2019s easy to lose track of how much equity you\u2019re tapping (and how much debt your home is serving as collateral for). Aven also offers a fully online experience, which is fine for the tech-savvy. But some borrowers might miss the option of in-person assistance. ## Aven home equity loan overview Aven was founded in 2019 by former executives from Facebook and Square. Its first product, the Aven Home Card, launched in 2022. Since its inception, Aven has issued over $1.5 billion in credit lines via the card. The fast-growing fintech company also offers a financial advisory tool, Aven Advisor. In July 2024, Aven announced it had received a new round of $142 million in investment funding. ### Aven home equity products offered Aven\u2019s product isn\u2019t a typical home equity line of credit (HELOC) or HE loan; it\u2019s a credit card. You\u2019ll get a line of credit based on your tappable home equity, like a HELOC, and receive unlimited 2 percent cash back on purchases, like a cash-back reward credit card. The card is a Visa card and backed by Coastal Community Bank, an FDIC-insured institution. Along with individual purchases, you can use the Aven HELOC card to cash out your home equity in large amounts, with the funds going directly into your designated bank account. You have the option to repay the funds in fixed installments over five or 10 years, similar to a home equity loan (\u201cAven Simple Loan\u201d). Aven also offers a HELOC refinance product, in which users can refinance their existing second -lien HELOC or home equity loan to an Aven HELOC. There are no origination or transfer fees associated with the refinance. ## Pros and cons of Aven ### Pros - Checkmark Icon No annual, origination, appraisal, notary or pre-payment fees. - Checkmark Icon"

Line of credit size is limited in 15 states. - Convenience of the card could encourage irresponsible use of home equity. ## How Bankrate scored Aven ### Affordability: 5/5 - **APR:** Aven now provides a lowest rate guarantee. If you're able to get a lower HELOC rate with another lender, it will beat the offer or send you $100. Its APRs for primary residences run between 7.74% and 15.24% (depending on your credit) \u2014 low compared to most credit cards. Also, Aven\u2019s maximum APR won\u2019t exceed 18 percent during the life of your account. - **Fees:**\u00a0There are no annual, sign-up, or prepayment fees, but you\u2019ll pay a 2.5% fee on cash outs and balance transfers. You will also be on the hook for a $29 late fee if you miss the minimum payment. The absence of fees, competitive APRs and the lowest rate guarantee all help Aven score a 5 out of 5 affordability rating. ### Availability:\u00a0 4.9/5 - **Credit score**: You will need a FICO score and VantageScore of at least 640, which is typical of home equity lenders. - **Loan products**: Aven\u2019s credit card allows you to tap into your home equity while offering cash rewards. All purchases you make with the Aven card will earn you unlimited 2 percent cash back. - **Where to find it:**\u00a0Aven is available in most U.S. states except Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Massachusetts, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New York, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia. The company has a goal of reaching all 50 states by 2025. Aven scores 4.9 out of 5 for availability due to its unique home equity credit card, ability to earn 2 percent cash back and its reach across the majority of states in the U.S."

Aven scores 4.9 out of 5 for availability due to its unique home equity credit card, ability to earn 2 percent cash back and its reach across the majority of states in the U.S. ### Borrower experience: 4.0/5 - **Rate transparency:** While you won\u2019t see your APR until you receive your offer, Aven only performs a \u201csoft pull\u201d on your credit report, which doesn\u2019t affect your credit score. (If you do accept the offer, a hard inquiry follows, which can temporarily impact your score.) - **Convenience:** Borrowers can use their Aven card to purchase anything wherever Visa cards are accepted. However, it can\u2019t be used for cash withdrawals from an ATM or bank. - **Customer service:** The application process can be completed completely online and if you need support, Aven is reachable by phone, email, online form, online chat and text message. Borrowers can use their card for purchases everywhere Visa is accepted and they offer multiple support options, giving Aven a 4 out of 5 for borrower experience. ## Aven\u2019s reputation While it\u2019s a relative newcomer in the home equity lending space, Aven gets a 4.9 out of 5 review on Trustpilot. ### What consumers say about Aven Despite a few digs about \u201cdelayed response times,\u201d customer reviews are largely glowing for Aven on Bankrate, especially for the \u201cfast,\u201d \u201csimple\u201d application process: \u201cSo easy to do, it's a no brainer for homeowners.\u201d ## How to qualify for a HELOC card with Aven Aven lets you take out as much as 89 percent of your home\u2019s equity. You will also need to have a FICO and a Vantage credit score of at least 640; customers with higher scores will get better rates.

If you obtain a credit line higher than $100,000, you\u2019ll also need to add Aven and Coastal Community Bank as beneficiaries on your homeowners insurance policy. ## How to apply with Aven You can apply for an Aven HELOC card on Aven\u2019s website, email them at [support@aven.com](mailto:support@aven.com) or call 415-582-6613. The application process typically takes just 15 minutes, according to the website. Checking just to see if you qualify for the card will not affect your credit score. Lightbulb Icon Bankrate insight You can tap into your home equity \u2014 the difference between your home's worth and what you owe on your mortgage \u2014 with a home equity loan or a HELOC. With those funds, you can tackle a variety of expenses, like debt consolidation or home renovations. However, before you dive in, it's important to figure out your loan-to-value ratio (LTV). Lenders use your LTV to determine how much of your equity stake you can actually borrow. (It\u2019s typically 80 percent, although some lenders allow you to access as much as 90 percent.)

    "text": "Yes! See the various options to get cash from Aven card Published Oct 27, 2023 | 1 min read Aven cardholders can use their Aven Card for purchase transactions wherever VISA cards are accepted. Aven cardholders can transfer cash directly from their Aven account to another bank account \u2013 it is called a CashOut. CashOuts are initiated within 2 business days of the request. For security reasons, there is a $50,000 daily limit, you will need to verify ownership of the bank account, and Aven does not allow cash to be withdrawn from a bank or ATM. Start a Cash Out. Transfer fee may apply. To transfer balance from a high interest credit card to the Aven card, cardholders can request a balance transfer (BT) to their credit card. BTs are initiated within 5 business days of the request. Transfer fee may apply."
